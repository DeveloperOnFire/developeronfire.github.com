		Kevin Grossnicklaus talks with Dave Rael about passion, software, business, learning, and mid-life crises
	</div>
	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>At one point in his career Kevin was the youngster on most development teams. He got his start developing with Visual Studio and managed .NET code during the early beta cycles in 2001. As a technical author, his first writing experience was for the Visual Basic.NET Bible released in 2002. He has been recognized as a Microsoft MVP since 2009 and is a member of the ASPInsiders program. He is also very active in the local St. Louis development community.
In 2009, Kevin Grossnicklaus started his own software product development firm called ArchitectNow (www.architectnow.net). At ArchitectNow, Kevin and his team specialize in a wide variety of tools and technologies and take pride in helping their customers deliver great solutions on a variety of platforms. As expected (and necessary) today, they are always on the lookout for the “next big thing” in the software or technology space while guiding customers through the waves of new technology.
Born in rural Nebraska, he has spent the last 20 years in St. Louis, Missouri where he lives with his wife Lynda and their three daughters: Alexis, Emily, and Hanna. He is an avid guitar player, home brewer, and gamer including everything from retro arcade games, to board games, to role playing games. When not spending time on any of those hobby’s he waits patiently for a second season of Firefly.</p>
