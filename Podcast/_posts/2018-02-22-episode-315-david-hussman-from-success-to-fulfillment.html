		<h6>David's top 3 tips for delivering more value:</h6>
        <ol>
		    <li>When you're confused, always pause and ask yourself why you're doing what you're doing because how you're doing it is learnable, but why you're doing it is more complex.</li>
<li>Challenge yourself to express, measurably if possible, what true impact will your activity have? Hopefully it's meaningful</li>
<li>What is your learning quotient across 12 months?</li>
        </ol>
