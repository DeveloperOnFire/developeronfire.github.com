	<div class="subtitle">
		Kyle Scarmardo talks with Dave Rael about being deliberate with your time, the importance of self-awareness, coaching and mentoring, and taking action
	</div>
	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>Kyle spent sixteen years in the Information Technology space for a large financial company, the 20th largest private company in America, where he worked his way up from the bottom to become an executive in 13 years at the age of 35. The latter part of his career heavily involved helping others with self-improvement, career growth, improving executive function, applying new strategies to better communicate and influence, and assist with culture change. In this work Kyle tapped into a passion that ultimately would pull him away from a full time focus on technology.
Kyle now spends more time assisting others looking to accelerate their careers, become more effective leaders, and take self-improvement to a deeper introspective level.
Kyle currently works with executives, middle management, and highly ambitious individuals in many sectors looking to climb fast or make their mark as entrepreneurs. This work is often times on an individual basis, but can be structured for teams where needed.
