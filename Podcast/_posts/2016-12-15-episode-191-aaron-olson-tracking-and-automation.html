		<p>Aaron Olson is an Operations Manager who has been hanging out in the IT distribution industry with a passion for making all things better with software.  He had been focused on the hardware side of the industry for 11 years until The Cloud showed up and completely changed how businesses consume IT resources.  All was not lost as it became an opportunity for him to start a business which provides cloud-based storage & security services, put more of his programming skills to work and discover his love for entrepreneurship.  When he's not working he enjoys spending time with his wife and 19 month old son and they are looking forward to the arrival of their 2nd child who is coming any day now.</p>
