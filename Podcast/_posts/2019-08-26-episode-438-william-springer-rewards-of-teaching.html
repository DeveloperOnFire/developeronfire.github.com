	<div class="subtitle">
		William Springer talks with Dave Rael about family, teaching, learning, computer science, schooling, and writing
	</div>
	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>In the past William Springer has worked as a math teacher, science teacher, AVID tutor, magazine writer, computer science TA, and textbook editor. He likes teaching but found middle school to be too stressful because the students took advantage of his being deaf, so he went back to school for his PhD and then became a developer. His day job is working for a company that makes medical software. He misses teaching, though, so he speaks at conferences (about computer science and accessibility) and write books. His latest book released Aug 1, 2019 - https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07VC1WV2Q

His hobbies include heavy economic board games, science fiction, and photography. He has a variable number of children (generally between 1 and 4) whom he spends a lot of time hanging out with.</p>
