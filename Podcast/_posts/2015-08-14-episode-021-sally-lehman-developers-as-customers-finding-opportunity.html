<p>Sally Lehman is an email geek. She grew up in various small towns in Oregon and Washington, and is a recent transplant to Tempe, AZ. Her first computer experiences were with EMACs, MS-DOS, and Ski Free when she was &lt;5 years old. She built out the Puppet and CI/CD server infrastructure for GoDaddy email marketing and Madmimi.com, and maintains uptime on a range of GoDaddy's existing email products. Sally's favorite movie is Office Space, and she makes a mean Tiramisu. She is a Bit Flipper and Three-Quarter-Stack Developer, as well as the Self-appointed Savior of bad SPF records.</p>
