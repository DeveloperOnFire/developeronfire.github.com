		<p>Andy Collins is a software developer and educator in Nashville, TN. Since earning a computer science degree in 2000, he has spent his career trying to be of service to others. From working as a public servant in government, to building software to support the continued education of healthcare professionals, to his current role as a senior instructor at Nashville Software School, he seeks out work that combines the technical with the human. As a developer his focus is on web development, primarily in the Microsoft stack.
