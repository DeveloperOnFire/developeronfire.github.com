		<h6>Poornima's top 3 tips for delivering more value:</h6>
        <ol>
		    <li>Put aside what you think you need to be doing - find the intersection of what you want and enjoy with fulfilling your needs and favor those over "should"</li>
<li>Think about how you interact with other people, especially whether you enjoy broad interactions with multiple people or an intimate inner circle</li>
<li>Only after taking care of yourself, turn your attention to deciding who you want to serve</li>
