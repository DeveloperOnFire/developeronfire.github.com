		Jakob Heuser talks with Dave Rael about the human side of engineering, training focused on learners, formative experiences, and making an impact
	</div>
	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>Jakob Heuser (HEW-zer) has taken up the mantle of Evangelist for human-centered instruction to help businesses, start-ups and brands retain talent. His unique blend of engineering and instructional experience results in a different kind of training; it’s optimized for the LEARNER, not the instructor. This approach is a breath of fresh air in a world overcrowded with ebooks and generic leadership seminars.
When surveyed by Gallup, 87% of millennials rate “professional or career growth and development opportunities” as the most important factor to them in a rewarding job. Yet in that same poll, less than 15 percent of all employees surveyed had received useful training or development opportunities in the last 30 days.
Jakob is turning that knowledge into action, helping businesses invest in their team. No matter if it’s your employees or their leaders, his goal is to help you turn your talent into an advantage.</p>
