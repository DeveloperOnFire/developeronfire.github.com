		John Wright talks with Dave Rael about remote work, working at Stack Overflow, speaking at conferences, and making an impact
	</div>
	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>John M. Wright has been a professional software developer for about 18 years, gaining experience ranging from “shrink-wrapped” software to large, distributed networks using multiple platforms and technologies. His experience spans the entire software lifecycle, from customer-facing requirements gathering, through development and release, and continued maintenance. Though he has experience in a management role, his passion lives in writing high-quality, clean code while providing leadership through technical direction and mentorship.

He enjoys sharing his experiences with automated testing, mocking frameworks, and static analysis tools, or guiding other developers through the darker crevices of the .NET framework, while also learning from his peers’ experiences -- helping everyone "level up" as a team.

He has a pragmatic approach to and a heavy interest in continuous improvement of people, process, and product. He's currently applying that experience as a Full-Stack Web Developer at Stack Overflow on the Internal Development team.</p>
