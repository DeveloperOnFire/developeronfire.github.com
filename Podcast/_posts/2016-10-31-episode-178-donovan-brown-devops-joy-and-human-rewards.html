		Donovan Brown talks with Dave Rael about growth, perspective, competition, DevOps, working for Microsoft, and speaking in front of audiences of all sizes
	</div>
	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>Meet The Man in the Black Shirt. Donovan Brown is a Senior DevOps Program Manager on Microsoft's US Developer Division team. Why is DevOps one of the hottest topics? Because it hurts the most. Luckily, Donovan's unofficial tag line is #RubDevOpsOnIt and he's here to make it all better. Before joining Microsoft, Donovan spent seven years as a Process Consultant and a Certified Scrum Master. Developer Tools are his thing. Donovan has travelled the globe helping companies in the U.S., Canada, India, Germany, and the UK develop solutions using agile practices, Visual Studio, and Team Foundation Server in industries as broad as Communications, Health Care, Energy, and Financial Services. What else keeps the wheels spinning on The Man in The Black Shirt? Donovan's also an avid programmer, often finding ways to integrate software into his other hobbies and activities, one of which is Professional Air Hockey where he has ranked as high as 11 in the world.
