	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>Lyndsey Padget is a Senior Software Engineer at Freightview in Kansas City, working primarily in NodeJS + ES6.  With over a dozen years of software and web development experience at both mega-corporations and startups, she specializes in designing maintainable and intuitive RESTful APIs.  She speaks about - and offers organizational training/consulting on - microservices, git concepts & workflow, and various soft skills (such as public speaking, teamwork, and the pursuit of badassery).  Trained in agile methodologies, she has been known to stunt-double as a project manager (and also, because she is bossy).  Lyndsey is involved in local organizations that encourage women, young and old, to explore careers in math and science.  She believes that the difference between a decent software engineer and a great one often has little to do with code.</p>
