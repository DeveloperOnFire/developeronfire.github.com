		Edaqa Mortoray talks with Dave Rael about software, writing, fiction, health, whole humans, being true to yourself, and finding common ground

	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>Edaqa Mortoray grew up programming. Long before he learned how to code,
he was already distilling reality, pulling out meaningful structure.
Code came along and gave him a way to express his ideas. And of course,
to control computers.

From the beauty of interface design and graphic rendering to the rigid
correctness of scientific and financial applications, Edaqa has weaved
all sorts of technical wonders. From entertaining video games to
sociable communications and practical development products, he's found a
home in many market sectors.

Beyond programming, Edaqa has an unusual palette of abilities. Most
relevant is his writing. Perhaps most known for his programming blog, he
also writes imaginative fiction and non-fiction alike. He's the author
of "What is Programming?".</p>
