		<h6>Justin's top 3 tips for delivering more value:</h6>
        <ol>
		    <li>Ask yourself if the solution is needed, if it's the simplest solution, and if it will deliver business value</li>
<li>If you teach something, you'll learn way more than you thought you would</li>
<li>Comparing ourselves to others is folly - I'm not better or worse than you, we're just at different points in our timeline</li>
