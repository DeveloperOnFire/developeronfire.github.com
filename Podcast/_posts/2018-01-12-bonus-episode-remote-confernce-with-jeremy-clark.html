			The Developer On Fire Remote Conference is January 22-24, 2018. It's an opportunity to interact with amazing geeks like Jeremy. You'll get to interact with speakers and other attendees, consume talks, and ask your questions. All the talks are pre-recorded. All the Question-and-Answer sessions will be streamed live and recorded for future consumption. The panel discussions will be streamed live and recorded for future consumption.

			You don't have to attend to benefit from registration.

Download the talks and watch them at your convenience. Watch the Q&A after the fact. You choose how and when you take it in.
