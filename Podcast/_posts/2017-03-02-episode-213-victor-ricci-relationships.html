	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>Victor Ricci is a college student, former Vine celebrity, and founder of Trend Pie, an influencer marketing platform that helps app developers drive cost effective downloads and whose customers include Sworkit, Unilever, Yahoo! Video Guide, Twisty Arrow and more.

Since its launch in April 2015, Trendpie has the following statistics: 250,000,000 follower reach, 500,000,000 ad impressions per month, 50+ paying clients, $0.40 average cost per install, and almost $1,000,000 in sales since the start.
Some highlights:

	* Generated over 80,000 downloads in one day

	* Helped drunk mode scale to over 1 million users

	* Have gotten countless apps trending on the AppStore


Ricci started taking social media more seriously when his Vine account, @QuickLifeHacks, amassed over 1,400,000 followers (one of the top 100 most followed accounts in the world). He was a social media personality for years so he understands the industry from both aspects. Ricci is currently a Senior at Seton Hall University pursuing a degree in Marketing.</p>
