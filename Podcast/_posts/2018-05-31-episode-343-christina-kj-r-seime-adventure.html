		Christina Kjær Seime talks with Dave Rael about family, coaching, travel, culture, agility, creating, and technology
	</div>
	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>Christina works as a Lean/Agile Coach at Miles - a Norwegian consultancy company. She is an active speaker at conferences in Norway and enjoys giving workshops on different Agile topics. She is devoted to get teams and organisations to collaborate and work efficiently, creating the best products possible, using principles from Agile and Lean. Since she graduated in 2004 she has been working in numerous development projects in telecommunications, energy, media and the public sector. The first years as a developer and later on as team lead, project manager and now coach. She is passionate and interested in all things related to creating great products, convinced that this relies as much on inter-human aspects and communication as it does on technology. She is curious by nature and right now she is on a one year sabbatical with her husband and two girls. A great opportunity to experience new places, cultures, people and to learn!
