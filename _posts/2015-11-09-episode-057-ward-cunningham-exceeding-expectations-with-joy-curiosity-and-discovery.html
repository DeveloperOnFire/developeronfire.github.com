<div class="subtitle">Ward Cunningham talks with Dave Rael about lasting impact, correlating with the history of computing and software, creating Wiki, and following your joy, curiosity, and discovery</div>
<div class="podcast-summary">
<p>Ward Cunningham is the American computer programmer who developed the first wiki and HyperCard. A pioneer in both design patterns and Extreme Programming, he started programming the software WikiWikiWeb in 1994 and installed it on the website of his software consultancy, Cunningham &amp; Cunningham (commonly known by its domain name, c2.com), on March 25, 1995, as an add-on to the Portland Pattern Repository. He pioneered ways of understanding object-oriented programming and patterns and innovated the design methodology of using class-responsibility-collaboration cards.</p>
