		Christin Gorman talks with Dave Rael about robots, including girls and women, and creating software consistent with conscience
	</div>
	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>Christin got her first job as a programmer back in the fall of 2000 while still studying computing. 15+ years on and she has no intention of moving up the career ladder, but hopes her experiences can benefit others through her writing (http://kranglefant.tumblr.com) and public speaking.  She spent her first 10 years working in the oil industry, among other things developing real-time seismic acquisition software.  Since 2010, she's been working mainly on software used in the Norwegian public sector. First as a contractor, then as an in house developer.  From April she will be joining a consulting firm called Kodemaker.</p>

        <ol>
		    <li>Prioritization is not about sorting your list, it's about taking things away from the list - say no</li>
<li>Get to know your user - use your software and sit with users doing their job and feel their pain</li>
<li>There's going to be work - don't be afraid to redo things and to work really hard</li>
