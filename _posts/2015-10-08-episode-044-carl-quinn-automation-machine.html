<div class="subtitle">Carl Quinn talks with Dave Rael about seeing computing and programming evolve, development tools, taking care of yourself, and automating everything</div>
<div class="podcast-summary">
<p>Carl Quinn has been developing software professionally for 35 years, starting with BASIC on an Apple II, slogging through C/C++ on DOS, Windows and embedded, and finally landing in the Java-on-Linux world. The one thread through his career has been an inexplicable attraction to developer tools, spending time building them at Borland (C++ &amp; Java IDEs), Sun (Java RAD), Google (Java &amp; C++ build system), Netflix (Java build and cloud deployment automation) and currently Riot Games (cloud platform), focused on Go and Docker automation. Carl also co-hosted the Java Posse podcast, the #1 ranked Java technology podcast.</p>
