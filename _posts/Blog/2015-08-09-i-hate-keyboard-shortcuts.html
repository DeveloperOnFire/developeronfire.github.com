title: I Hate Keyboard Shortcuts
---

<p>The title of this post is terribly misleading.&nbsp; I would apologize for that, but that would imply I regret having misled you.&nbsp; In fact, that was my evil intention all along.&nbsp; It’s not controlling operating systems and applications from the command line with which I want to dispose, it calling keyboard controls by the insidious name “keyboard shortcuts.”&nbsp; It’s not using keyboard shortcuts, it’s the term “keyboard shortcuts” that here draws my ire.</p> <p><a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/I-Hate-Keyboard-Shortcuts_6061/path-least-resistance-maze_2.jpg"><img title="path-least-resistance-maze" style="border-top: 0px;

Input via other means are, at best, useful augmentations to this primary input.&nbsp; There may be a time in the future when that changes.</p> <p>Speech has the potential to become a better way.&nbsp; It’s not to that point, though, except at times when keyboard use is impractical or impossible, mostly in mobile use cases.&nbsp; Input directly from your thoughts into the machine via some sort of mind embed or thought-wave reading device would probably be the ideal form of input if that ever becomes a reality (though imagine the privacy and security concerns around something like that).&nbsp; Touch is nice for some uses and some things and works extremely well on small devices and with mobility as a primary concern.</p> <p>When all other things are equal, though, especially when sitting (or standing) at a desk, the keyboard is still king.</p> <p><a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/I-Hate-Keyboard-Shortcuts_6061/xB3zZ_2.jpg"><img title="xB3zZ" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="xB3zZ" src="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/I-Hate-Keyboard-Shortcuts_6061/xB3zZ_thumb.jpg" width="640" height="269"></a></p> <h3>Permanent Beginners</h3> <p>Because of the primacy of the keyboard in interacting with machines, calling input via the keyboard shortcuts is both a reflection and a contributor to the mentality destroying productivity in the world today.&nbsp; The context switch between keyboard and mouse and back again is more costly than we tend to think.&nbsp; Controlling your applications with the keyboard is the best way to interact.</p> <p>Calling keyboard controls shortcuts implies that mouse controls are the default and normal way to interact with a machine and you only use keyboard controls if you are different from the norm.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that is the case.&nbsp; Learning how to use your tools and interact with a machine optimally is done only by a minority of computer users.</p> <p>This is suboptimal.</p> <p>It’s worse the suboptimal, it’s counterproductive.&nbsp; Using menus and pointer control to get something done is useful because of discoverability and helps beginners.&nbsp; If you are using an application on a regular basis and haven’t figured out how to do what you need to do in better ways, you are still a beginner.&nbsp; You can do better.</p> <p><a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/I-Hate-Keyboard-Shortcuts_6061/13400582957558_2.jpg"><img title="13400582957558" style="border-top: 0px;

You are using keyboard controls, not “keyboard shortcuts.”&nbsp; Yes, I know I’m just getting hung up on words and it is typically of little consequence how you refer to these things.&nbsp; Yes, I know the shift I’m calling for here is subtle and may not matter.&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rose_by_any_other_name_would_smell_as_sweet" target="_blank">A rose by any other name….</a>.</p> <p>I’m really talking, though, about a change in the mentality of computer users, especially developers (who should know better), and a changing of priority.&nbsp; If you want to say “I’m using keyboard shortcuts” and make that your primary way of interacting with your computer, I’m ok with that.</p> <p>Language matters, though.&nbsp; What you mean is more important than what you say, but what you say has an impact on what you mean and, more importantly, what you communicate.</p> <p>The point of my rant here is not really about the word, but that I just think the term gives away an emphasis that is counterproductive.&nbsp; Life if better when you know how to use your chosen tools and control them from the keyboard.&nbsp; In such a life, the keyboard is not a shortcut, it’s a way of life.</p> <h3>The Keyboard as a Proxy for How you Live Your Life</h3> <p>And there’s a larger point about life: It is fine to discover what and how you want to do things via many paths and not necessarily knowing the best approaches.&nbsp; It is good to have a surface-level understanding of many things and to have a broad knowledge.&nbsp; For those things, though, in which you specialize – those things you do on a regular basis, those things you mention when asked “So, what do you do?” – you must learn how to do them the best way you can.</p> <p><a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/blog/know-how-to-use-your-tools" target="_blank">Know how to use your tools!</a></p> <p>Clicking around on your mouse, knowing you could be doing what you are doing better and more optimally is a proxy for how you live your life.&nbsp; “<a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2014/05/how-you-do-anything-is-how-you-do-everything/" target="_blank">How you do anything is how you do everything.</a>”&nbsp; (This quote is attributed to so many different sources I cannot possibly trace it to a real origin, let’s just call is a proverb.)</p> <p>That’s where I want to be and, ideally, I want you there with me.&nbsp; We’ll be better together.</p>
