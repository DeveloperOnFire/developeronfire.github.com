title: Giving It Away
---

<p><font size="3">I read a </font><a href="http://wilwheaton.net/2015/10/you-cant-pay-your-rent-with-the-unique-platform-and-reach-our-site-provides/" target="_blank"><font size="3">blog post I hated</font></a><font size="3">.</font></p> <p><font size="3">It was written by a guy named Wil Wheaton.&nbsp; Apparently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wil_Wheaton" target="_blank">he’s pretty well-known as a actor</a> (don’t worry – I didn’t know he was an actor when I read his post and it wasn’t my distaste for actors that drove this).&nbsp; In the post to which I object, he linked to </font><a href="http://wilwheaton.net/2015/10/seven-things-i-did-to-reboot-my-life/" target="_blank"><font size="3">another post</font></a><font size="3"> (that was the source of the request to share his content that was the source of his indignation) that I also read.&nbsp; It’s awesome and inspiring and worth a read.&nbsp; He’s evidently a pretty thoughtful guy and has a lot of good things to say.&nbsp; It’s clear he’s interested in producing excellent content and sharing it with people who can use it to their benefit.&nbsp; Sharing his struggle, his battle with depression, is helpful to many.&nbsp; His vulnerability in doing so is a beautiful thing.</font></p> <p><font size="3">Thank you for that, Wil.</font></p> <p><font size="3">Yet I really hated his post about being asked to share his content without being paid.</font></p> <p><a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/a875c6f779b7_C70E/money-652560_640_2.jpg"><font size="3"><img title="money-652560_640" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="money-652560_640" src="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/a875c6f779b7_C70E/money-652560_640_thumb.jpg" width="576" height="480"></font></a></p> <p><font size="3">It wasn’t so much the central premise I hated as the way it was delivered.&nbsp; It was the attitude.&nbsp; The point of the post was that you don’t have to give away content for free and that you should value yourself and what you create.&nbsp; These things are clear and self-evident.&nbsp; It seemed to go further (though not explicitly) in stating that you have an obligation to be paid for your labor.&nbsp; I disagree with this implication, but it’s something not worthy of writing a further rebuttal.</font></p> <p><font size="3">I didn’t hate the post b<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>ecause of the emphasis on the individual.&nbsp; This is actually something with which I agree and that is very near and dear to my heart.&nbsp; I love this.&nbsp; I like to say that I am very much an advocate for the smallest and most underrepresented minority in the world: the individual.</font></p> <p><font size="3">Yes, if you create something or do something or provide something of value, you should be rewarded for that.</font></p> <p><font size="3">Yes, if you don’t seek reward, it will often not be given to you.</font></p> <p><font size="3">I think all human relationships should be mutually beneficial or they should be severed.&nbsp; If someone asks you for something and you don’t feel the arrangement would give you reciprocal value, telling them no is a perfectly acceptable answer.&nbsp; It is the best answer you can give.</font></p> <p><font size="3">That’s the thing, though.&nbsp; Saying no should be enough.&nbsp; Asked and answered.&nbsp; This business of making someone out to be a villain for having the gall to ask for a favor is harmful.&nbsp; This whole business of ire and an attitude of “how dare you” ask me for something is offensive.&nbsp; People ask for things all the time, and they should be welcome to do so.&nbsp; It’s a request, not an insult.&nbsp; It’s a compliment that someone wants to share your content.&nbsp; That they want to do so without paying you may be adequate reason to say no, but it’s not a reason to give them grief.&nbsp; Someone asked you for something and you said no.&nbsp; This does not make you better than them.</font></p> <p><font size="3">I write posts for </font><a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/author/daverael/" target="_blank"><font size="3">John Sonmez’s Simple Programmer site</font></a><font size="3">.&nbsp; I like doing it and it gets my writing in front of a different audience in a different place.&nbsp; It gives me a chance to interact with editors and graphic artists and to create a really nice product I wouldn’t take the time to do on my own.&nbsp; It helps me grow.&nbsp; Plain and simply, I like John and I like his team and doing things for him/them is a pleasurable experience for me.&nbsp; John gets my content to share without having to pay me with money.&nbsp; I get adequate compensation in the transaction.&nbsp; It is beneficial to everyone involved.&nbsp; If it stops being beneficial, I’ll stop doing it.&nbsp; This is as it should be.</font></p> <p><font size="3">It’s for me to decide what is adequate payment for my work and for no one else.</font></p> <p><font size="3">Money is not the only form of payment.&nbsp; Exposure certainly can be a valid reason for doing something.&nbsp; I don’t see why that suggestion is so offensive.&nbsp; Sharing content with an audience is an act that helps to establish further relationships.&nbsp; Sharing content for free on your own blog is only slightly different than doing so on someone else’s.</font></p> <p><font size="3">I also ask awesome developers to have conversations with me that I record and share in the form of the </font><a href="http://developeronfire.com/Podcast" target="_blank"><font size="3">Developer On Fire podcast</font></a><font size="3">.&nbsp; I do not offer them any money for doing it and I’ve still had great success in getting some of the most amazing developers in the world to talk to me.&nbsp; Many of them have reported having great experiences in being involved with my show.&nbsp; If they had an attitude of superiority and a condescending moralizing over my evil at daring to ask them to talk to me, they’d have missed out on the rewards of sharing their stories on my podcast.</font></p> <p><font size="3">I’m a geek and it is one of the great successes in my recent life to have done something so uncomfortable to me as to start reaching out to people I like and admire and ask them for something.&nbsp; That has not been easy for me.</font></p> <p><font size="3">Of course, I’m not just asking.&nbsp; I’m making an offer for something I think benefits them as well.</font></p> <p><font size="3">There have been several potential guests I have asked for interviews who have declined.&nbsp; I am not going to reveal names – I asked privately because I want honest answers about the desire to participate without any attempt to shame someone for saying no.&nbsp; I don’t want anyone to feel obligated and I don’t want any of my listeners to think less of someone because they turned me down.&nbsp; They are at liberty to say no and have no obligation to speak to me.&nbsp; Those who have told me no have done so graciously and I cannot ask for anything more.</font></p> <p><font size="3">I asked and they said no and that’s the end of the story.&nbsp; I would not like it if they were to go on a rant about how some guy asked them for an interview and “can you imagine” and “the nerve.”&nbsp; I haven’t experienced that directly, but that’s how I felt for the people asking Wil Wheaton if he’d be willing to share his content.</font></p> <p><font size="3">Publicly ranting about merely asking and making someone who would ask for something that may be mutually beneficial out to be an evil fiend is problematic and it’s sad.&nbsp; It’s like ridiculing someone for expressing a romantic interest in you.&nbsp; If you’re not interested, you can decline without making a production out of how incensed you are at the mere suggestion.&nbsp; Come on – it was intended to be something you might even like.</font></p> <p><font size="3">Offering to enter into a relationship with someone is a gift.&nbsp; It’s an act of vulnerability.&nbsp; It is an emotional ordeal to deal with potential rejection – it shouldn’t be as hard as it is to reach out, but it’s tough for humans.&nbsp; When someone does that for you, they deserve your thanks.&nbsp; It’s something to be celebrated.&nbsp; It is a cause for rejoicing, even if you don’t want the offer they bring you.</font></p> <p><font size="3">That people respond to requests as though they were assaults is a big part of the problem.&nbsp; If someone likes you and wants an association with you, is it really helpful to belittle them, especially publicly?&nbsp; This is why “no, thanks” is such a popular formulation.&nbsp; It captures the sentiment of not being interested in going forward with the offer, but understanding that it was offered from a perspective of hoping for mutual benefit.</font></p> <p><font size="3">Being nasty provides no value.</font></p> <p><font size="3">If someone expresses thinking your are worth their while and you respond with ranting, indignation, and/or ridicule, they were wrong in their premise of thinking you’re worth the time.</font></p> <p><font size="3">You don’t have to say yes and I agree that you often shouldn’t, but the act of asking is not something to take as a negative – in fact it’s quite the opposite.</font></p> <p><font size="3"></font></p>
