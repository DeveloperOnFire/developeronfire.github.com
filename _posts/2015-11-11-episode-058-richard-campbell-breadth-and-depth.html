<h6>Richard's top 3 tips for delivering more value:</h6>
<p>1. Make sure you truly understand the problem<br />2. Avoid the trap of making it look like something was easy for you in a way that devalues your effort and provokes feelings of others thinking you think they're stupid<br />3. Show your work - provide the path to the answer and let your collaborators and cutomers come to the answer themselves<br /><br /></p>
