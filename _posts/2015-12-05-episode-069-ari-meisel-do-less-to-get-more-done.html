<div class="podcast-summary">
<p>Ari Meisel is the founder of LessDoing.com. In 2006, he developed a painful chronic autoimmune condition of the gut called Crohn&rsquo;s disease. After taking a dozen medications and several hospitalizations, he committed to doing whatever it took to overcome his disease. Through a combination of yoga, nutrition, natural supplements and rigorous exercise he was able to fight back the symptoms of Crohn&rsquo;s until he was finally able to suspend his medication. Eventually he was declared free of all traces of the &lsquo;incurable&rsquo; disease, and competed in Ironman France in June of 2011. Through the process of data collection, self tracking, and analysis, he developed Less Doing. This was a system of dealing with the daily stresses of life by optimizing, automating, and outsourcing all of one&rsquo;s tasks in life and business. Now he focuses on Achievement Architecture, helping individuals and companies to be more effective at everything.</p>
