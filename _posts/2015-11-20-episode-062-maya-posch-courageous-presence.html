<div class="podcast-summary">
<p>Maya Posch is a software engineer by trade and self-professed electronics, robotics and AI nut. She runs her own software development company ('Nyanko') together with her good friend Trevor Purdy, where she works on various game development projects and also some non-game projects. She also does various freelance jobs for companies around the globe. Beyond writing software, she like to play with equations and write novels, such as her awesome re-imagining of the story of the Nintendo classic Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and the survival-horror novel she recently started titled Viral Desire. Another major topic of interest for Maya is that of biochemistry, robotics and the reverse-engineering of the human body.</p>
