<p>Oren's top 3 tips for delivering more value:<br /> 1. Figure out who is paying and who is the customer (usually not the same - paying for the software vs using the software)<br /> 2. Be aware of how you are being measured - define your success criteria.<br /> 3. Understand how you are providing value and your incentives</p>
