		Jerry Weinberg talks with Dave Rael about family, quality and value, teaching and learning and the futility of lecture, and Jerry shares amazing stories
	</div>
	<div class="podcast-summary">
		<p>Gerald M. Weinberg (Jerry) has always been interested in helping smart people be happy and productive. To that end, he has published books on human behavior, including Weinberg on Writing: The Fieldstone Method, The Psychology of Computer Programming, Perfect Software and Other Fallacies, and the 4-volume General Systems Series. He has also written several books on teamwork and leadership including Becoming a Technical Leader, Agile Impressions, Do You Want to Be a (better) Manager, The Secrets of Consulting, More Secrets of Consulting, and the multi-volume Quality Software series.

He incorporates his knowledge of science, engineering, and human behavior into all of writing and consulting work (with writers, hi-tech researchers, and software engineers). He writes novels about such peopleâ€”all about how his brilliant protagonists produce quality work and learn to be happy.

		<h6>Jerry's top 3 tips for delivering more value:</h6>
        <ol>
		    <li>Operate from your center - Make sure what you're delivering is not about you (be like a window through which you can see, not a church window)</li>
<li>Know your customer - know to whom you are delivering</li>
<li>Delivering something about which you care</li>
        </ol>
