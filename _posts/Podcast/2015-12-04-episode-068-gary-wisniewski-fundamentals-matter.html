He was the system architect in several commercial software products, including the Ashton-Tate Professional Compiler, Microsoft DBGrid for Visual Studio, and even had 15-minutes of fame in the mid-80&rsquo;s for developing the hardware, software and manufacturing techniques for one of the first 16-bit microcomputers. In 1996, Gary established a respected web development agency in Melbourne Australia. Projects focused on entertainment properties for major record companies like BMG, Universal Music, Warner Music, and others. 1999 led to a new division that pioneered broadband webcasting in Asia-Pacific, using television crews to do some of the worlds first professional webcasts. Gary has done some pretty odd stuff as well. For 3 years, Gary and two partners created SLCN (now Treet.TV), the worlds first virtual television network with regular programming from Virtual Worlds.
