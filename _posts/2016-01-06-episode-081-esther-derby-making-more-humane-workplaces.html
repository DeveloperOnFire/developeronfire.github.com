<div class="subtitle">Esther Derby talks with Dave Rael about changes in software development, abusive environments, and facilitating learning and growth</div>
<div class="podcast-summary">
<p>Esther Derby started her career as a programmer, and over the years she's worn many hats, including business owner, internal consultant and manager. From all these perspectives, one thing became clear: our level of individual, team and company success was deeply impacted by our work environment and organizational dynamics. As a result, she has spent the last twenty-five years helping companies design their environment, culture, and human dynamics for optimum success. She has written over 100 articles, and co-authored two books&ndash;Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great and Behind Closed Doors: Secrets of Great Management. She writes about management, leadership, collaboration, organizations and change (or another topic I&rsquo;m currently exploring).</p>
