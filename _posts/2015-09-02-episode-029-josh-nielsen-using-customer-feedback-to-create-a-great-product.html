<div class="podcast-summary">
<p>Josh Nielsen started programming when he got a job as a webmaster for a University website while in school. All he knew was basic html and css and got put in charge of python and php applications. He was forced to learn fast. He dropped out of college with one semester left to take a job at a startup and learned more working there for 3 months than he did in his entire University program. He quickly caught the entrepreneur bug and moved to Boulder, CO spending a summer working as a developer for Techstars and then started on a series of attempts to start his own company. On a road littered with failures, and with a baby on the way, he switched gears to a more readily achievable project called Zencastr.</p>
