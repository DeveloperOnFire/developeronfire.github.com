<p>I have <a href="http://developeronfire.com/blog/self-tracking%E2%80%93motivations-goals-and-effort" target="_blank">written before about self tracking</a> and why, when, and how you would want to do it.&nbsp; I missed something spectacular in that post
  I should have included.&nbsp; Actually, I didn’t realize this was the case until now.&nbsp; I have known for quite a while that <a href="https://ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> has a <a href="https://ifttt.com/github" target="_blank">GitHub integration</a>.&nbsp;
  This thrilled me when I first discovered it, but I was quickly disappointed.&nbsp; IFTTT only offers triggers on GitHub issues, new repositories, and pull requests and actions on issues.&nbsp; These are useful for many things, but I had high hopes for
  setting up automation based on commits being pushed into GitHub repositories and thought this was going to have to be something I’d implement myself.&nbsp; I was bummed after the initial jolt of excitement.&nbsp; This is still the case – the GitHub
  channel on IFTTT has this limitation.</p>

<p>The beauty of something like IFTTT, though is that it is an idea that is repeatable.&nbsp; Integrating great services on the web that offer APIs and use OAuth is a problem worthy of solving and worthy of solving in different ways and for different purposes.&nbsp;
  <a href="https://zapier.com" target="_blank">Zapier</a> is a service similar to IFTTT, but with many subtle and not-so-subtle differences.&nbsp; It is sometimes the case that what you want isn’t supported on one of these, but is on the other.&nbsp;
  I didn’t even think at first to check what Zapier had to offer regarding my favorite remote source control providers.&nbsp; It turns out <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/github/" target="_blank">Zapier’s GitHub integration</a> supports exactly what
  I sought.&nbsp; Not only does it support triggers on GitHub commits, it also has this <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">support for BitBucket</a> as well.&nbsp; Oh, happy and joyous day!&nbsp; Simply committing to a repository and pushing
  my branch to my GitHub or BitBucket repository can trigger automations for which I don’t have to test and write any code.</p>
<p>I mentioned in my other post about tracking that I like to use <a href="https://idonethis.com" target="_blank">iDoneThis</a>.&nbsp; It turns out <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/i-done-this/" target="_blank">Zapier also hooks into IDoneThis</a>.&nbsp;
  This means the automation I really want – tracking my accomplishments using IDoneThis for tasks associated with code in the projects on which I work happens easily and automatically.&nbsp; Every commit to repositories I have set up for tracking (on
  branches I have set up for tracking) and push to my remote repositories automatically create a done in iDoneThis.&nbsp; When I receive my daily iDoneThis email, all I need to do is respond with personal done items (like things I did with my children
  and reading I got done – though I’m thinking I’ll soon figure out a way to leverage Kindle software to automatically report what I have read for a day – that would be sweet – let me know if you know a way to do this).&nbsp; It comes to mind too that
  tracking commits against issues on <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> cards or in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank">Jira</a> or something (if you’re not using GitHub for your issues) like that would
  have value.</p>
<p>There are two lessons to take away from this post:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if you have something you want to get done with an automated integration services, check all your options before giving up.</li>
  <li>The Zapier integration with GitHub and BitBucket is awesome and useful and makes tracking efforts much easier.</li>
</ul>
