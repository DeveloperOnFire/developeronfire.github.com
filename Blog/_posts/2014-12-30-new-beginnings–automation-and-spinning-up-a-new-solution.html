<p>In this time of year when attention is often turned to closing the book on the year that is finishing and starting a new one with a fresh start and the intention to improve, I wanted to talk about something simple, but not as automatic as it should be.&nbsp;
  It is a common mantra among the <a href="http://swizec.com/blog/programmers-are-fucking-lazy/swizec/2648" target="_blank">laziest of software persons</a> that <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate" target="_blank">if you do something a third time, you need to automate it</a>.&nbsp;
  If you listen to <a href="http://lessdoing.com/" target="_blank">Ari Meisel</a> (and you should – <a href="https://lessdoinglabs.businessresearchgroup.org/sales/live-event-optin" target="_blank">his live event</a> in New York in May 2015 is going to
  be epic – I’ll be there and you should too), you hear a lot about simplifying life and optimizing the flow of what you do – and then automating it.&nbsp; Of course, as a software professional, automation is the core part of my being and I have a giddy
  feeling inside every time I get in my van and look at the climate control setting by which I have just set a temperature and never have to think again about changing the blowing of heating and cooling to try to find a comfortable temperature.&nbsp;
  Automation is the 4th best thing about life (behind only playing with children, having sex, and eating – in that order).</p>

<p>Creating a new solution using Visual Studio is pretty straightforward, but we can do better.&nbsp; I have created a video illustrating what it is like to go through the process of creating a solution complete with source control.&nbsp; This is not incredibly
  cumbersome and painful, but we can do better.&nbsp; Please watch the video and consider the effort and time taken here in doing something that will be repeated any time you create a new solution.</p>

</p>
<p>Now consider the alternative I am presenting here.&nbsp; I have a script function that will create a new solution.</p>

</p>
<p>The function I have created is in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell" target="_blank">PowerShell</a> script.&nbsp; It is available in my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/raelyard/setup" target="_blank">Setup repository</a> on
  <a
  href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> to use as you see fit.&nbsp; Note that this is a <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" target="_blank">Mercurial</a> repository and my script for creating repositories and solutions creates <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>    repositories.&nbsp; I am fond of both of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control" target="_blank">Distributed Version Control Systems</a> and use them both at different times.&nbsp; Perhaps I’ll write another post
    on what I like about each of them and what I view as their relative strengths, including hosts such as <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a>, at another time.&nbsp;
    I might also add Mercurial support to my new repository automation scripts at some point as well.</p>
<p>My Setup repository has several things I find useful and use in my daily life.&nbsp; Among these things are several Powershell scripts,functions, and aliases intended to make my day nicer and a script to put these conveniences into my profile so I never
  have to hunt for them.</p>
<p>In essence, instead of having to use git init to create a repository, manually create an ignore file, use git add and git commit to add the ignore file to the repository, and wrestle with Visual Studio to get my paths right (which I never get right on
  the first try – and you’ll note if you look closely in the video that I created a solution called NewWeb.sln when I intended to create NewSolution.sln), I just run a script and give it a name as a parameter.</p>
