<p>Visualizing the changes you have in your working directory before committing is critical to sound use and value from source control.&nbsp; git difftool is a convenient command to use when working with git to walk through the unstaged files in your working
  directory with changes to see what is different.&nbsp; When working with Mercurial, you can do pretty much the same thing with just a little bit of setup.</p>

<p>My preference for a tool to use for viewing changes in source control is <a href="http://winmerge.org/">Winmerge</a>.&nbsp; As such, this post will walk through setting up Mercurial to easily view what has changed in different changesets or (more importantly
  for most day-to-day operations), between the tip changeset and what is in your working directory using Winmerge.</p>
<p>Using Git, I always set up Winmerge as the application that responds to
  <br />git difftool.</p>
<p>This handy command, when configured as I like it, cycles through all the unstaged changes in your working directory (or the staged changed with the &ndash;cached parameter) and present a visual diff in your tool of choice, file by file.&nbsp; Look for
  an upcoming post on how I like to set up my git environment.</p>
<p>With Mercurial, something similar can be accomplished pretty easily.&nbsp; There are two methods I typically use to view my changes before committing or to compare changesets.&nbsp; The first is to use TortoiseHg.&nbsp; The commit dialog is pretty nice.&nbsp;
  It presents everything dirty in your working directory with the opportunity to view differences right in the dialog or via Ctrl+D, you can pop open your configured visual diff tool (Winmerge for me) to compare your working directory copy of the file
  with your repository.&nbsp; This works pretty nicely.&nbsp; I have only one complaint about it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s painful to select a file from the list to view the diff.&nbsp; TortoiseHg doesn&rsquo;t have a keyboard shortcut for moving focus to the
  list of changed files.&nbsp; The options (of which I am aware) are to use the mouse (to which I am religiously opposed) or to go through a sequence of 10ish keystrokes.&nbsp; Both of these are undesirable.</p>
<p>There is another option for inspecting differences that is close to what you get with
  <br />git difftool</p>
<p>A good description of how to set up can be found <a href="http://blog.stevehorn.cc/blog/easy-mercurial-visual-diff-between-two.html">here</a>.&nbsp; He did a pretty good job of giving you what you need to use this.&nbsp; I prefer, though, to use &ldquo;difftool&rdquo;
  as my command, rather than Winmerge to have a little more consistency with git and have to think less when moving back and forth between them.&nbsp; He also has a lot of extra parameters that aren&rsquo;t necessary (the &ldquo;incantations&rdquo;).</p>
<p>What I landed on having in my mercurial.ini (among other stuff) is this:</p>
<p>[extensions]
  <br />hgext.extdiff=
  <br />[extdiff]
  <br />cmd.difftool = C:\Program Files (x86)\WinMerge\WinMergeU.exe
  <br />opts.difftool&nbsp; = /e /x /ub /wl</p>
<p>This results in the capability of doing some work in my working directory and then issuing:
  <br />hg difftool</p>
<p>to open Winmerge showing all the dirty changes in my working directory.</p>
<p>I can also look at the changes to a specific file with something like:
  <br />hg difftool .hgignore</p>
<p>In addition, I can compare my working directory with any changeset in the repository with the &ndash;r switch:
  <br />hg difftool &ndash;r SomeBranch
  <br />or
  <br />hg difftool &ndash;r SomeTag
  <br />or
  <br />hg difftool &ndash;r 3f72f49aa3301a93c1382415577f6ff7fd3cadc9
  <br />(where this is a hash representing a changeset)
  <br />or
  <br />hg difftool &ndash;r 10
  <br />(where 10 is a number representing a changeset)</p>
<p>Hopefully this will make your life and your interaction with source control easier.</p>
