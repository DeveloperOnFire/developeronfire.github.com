<p>At the end of September 2014, I’ll be making a trip to New York to go and see the guys from <a href="http://particular.net/" target="_blank">Particular Software</a> and a whole slew of other excellent geeks.&nbsp; I’m really excited about this experience.&nbsp;
  I have been using <a href="http://particular.net/nservicebus" target="_blank">NServiceBus</a> for many years and I am big fan of the way of thinking of <a href="http://www.udidahan.com/" target="_blank">Udi Dahan</a> as he shares it in his famous
  <a
  href="http://particular.net/adsd" target="_blank">Advanced Distributed Systems Design (ADSD)</a> training for a long time.&nbsp; I attended the ADSD course in April 2010 and it shook me to my foundations.&nbsp; Udi described acceptance of what he presented as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill"
    target="_blank">a choice between taking the red pill or the blue pill</a>, and he wasn’t kidding.&nbsp; Udi questions a lot of assumptions about systems architecture and comes to some radically different conclusions than the mainstream.&nbsp; Thinking
    about things in the Service-Oriented way of the ADSD mindset and embracing the infrastructure provided by NServiceBus and the rest of the Particular Platform that enables a straightforward way of implementing highly reliable and highly scalable systems
    is quite a departure.&nbsp; Every day during the training I felt exhausted and beaten up, like I’d been dragged up and down the street behind a speeding car.&nbsp; It was a grueling five days of consuming from a fire hose.</p>
<p>So now I’ll get to experience the conference about NServiceBus to see what folks are doing with the fantastic product that is now all grown up and has become a <a href="http://particular.net/service-platform" target="_blank">fully-featured platform</a>  at <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6223-nsbcon-nyc-2014" target="_blank">NSBCon</a>.&nbsp; I can remember at times pitching NServiceBus and getting resistance and whining because of a lack of graphical tooling.&nbsp; That stuff is all
  there now.&nbsp; It will be great to meet some brilliant geeks and see what people from around the globe are doing with the tools I find so appealing.&nbsp; Of course Udi Dahan will be at the conference and speaking, but the docket also includes other
  huge names, such as <a href="http://ayende.com/blog" target="_blank">Oren Eini</a>, <a href="http://www.tedneward.com/" target="_blank">Ted Neward</a>, <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/" target="_blank">Richard Campbell, and Carl Franklin</a>.&nbsp;
  I’ll especially be looking forward to hearing from <a href="http://andreasohlund.net/" target="_blank">Andreas Ohlund</a> and <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/" target="_blank">Jimmy Bogard</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>The day after the conference, there will be another day that is the <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6222-adsd-unconference-nyc" target="_blank">ADSD Unconference</a> for alumni of the course to gather and share experiences and opinions on
  the application of what Udi preaches.&nbsp; This is what is really exciting to me.&nbsp; The content of the ADSD course was a bit of a combination of a crash course in the practical computer science that was missing from college, Domain-Driven Design
  with some twists, and applying DDD and NServiceBus to large-scale problems.&nbsp; There is no way to do the 5 days of baptism by fire justice by trying to describe it in a block of text consumable in the reasonable amount of time.&nbsp; It is something
  that has to be experienced.&nbsp; With his focus on being the CEO of Particular, Udi has stated he’s not teaching the course anymore (though that may not be absolutely true), but it is <a href="http://particular.net/adsd" target="_blank">available on video</a>.&nbsp;
  Experiencing this gathering of largely like minds in software and systems architecture and cloud deployments and such will be something I would not want to miss.</p>
