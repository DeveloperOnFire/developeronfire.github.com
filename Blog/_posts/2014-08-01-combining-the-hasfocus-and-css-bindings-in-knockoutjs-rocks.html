}</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, when thinking about wanting to have multiple textboxes on a user interface in the browser and styling that should apply only to the one currently under edit, one starts to think about having multiple events to have to worry about to make sure to handle gaining and losing focus and having to apply styling and responding to events.&nbsp; This can become pretty painful.&nbsp; With <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">KnockoutJS</a>, it’s a snap.&nbsp; The key to the simplicity with which a knockout application can handle these changes is in the nature of the two-way binding that is the bread and butter of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">KnockoutJS</a> in the first place.&nbsp; By using hasFocus and binding it to a property of the viewmodel that is also bound to a CSS class, changes to the model or changes in the user interface cause focus and classes to change.&nbsp; This means that simply through declarative binding in my markup, I’m able to handle changes to style, changes to focus, and respond to keyboard (and mouse) events.&nbsp; In order to support the multiple things I’d like to see happen when a user interface input element gains or loses focus, I need to do nothing more than use <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">KnockoutJS</a> bindings.&nbsp; Here is a sample of what a textbox looks like in my markup:</p><pre>&lt;input type="text" id="title" data-bind="value:title, css: {editing: editingTitle}, hasfocus:editingTitle, event: { 'keyup': $root.textboxKeyup }"&gt;
</pre>
<p>In this example, when a textbox gains focus, the editingTitle property gets changed to false as a result of the write portion of the two-way binding.&nbsp; This notifies that css binding of an update to the viewmodel such that the “editing” class gets added to the input.&nbsp; If one textbox has focus and the user clicks on another, the textbox with focus in the beginning loses it, causing an update to the viewmodel and a notification that results in a removal of the class and the newly focused textbox has the opposite result and both are now properly styled and with correct focus.&nbsp; Therefore, the styling of elements and the status of the focus are kept in lock-step, regardless of whether focus changed because of mouse clicks, viewmodel code, or keyboard event handlers.&nbsp; This is a slick and simple way of handling something that otherwise could be hairy and prone to bugs and due to missing event handlers and overlooked cases.</p>
<p>In the viewmodel, I have something like this:</p><pre>function ViewModel(durationSeconds) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var self = this;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.title = ko.observable('');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.editingTitle = ko.observable(false);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.headline = ko.observable('');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.editingHeadline = ko.observable(false);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
}</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is nothing particularly exciting about this code – it’s pretty run-of-the-mill knockout viewmodel source.&nbsp; I included it here merely for completeness in showing what this example looks like.</p>

<p>So there you have it – binding the same property for an input to both a css class and to hasFocus makes it simple to declaratively emphasize the selected user interface element with whatever styling you choose and to not have to worry about remembering to remove that styling when the control blurs.</p>
