<p>In <a href="http://developeronfire.com/blog/combining-the-hasfocus-and-css-bindings-in-knockoutjs-rocks" target="_blank">an earlier post</a>, I commented on using combining the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/hasfocus-binding.html" target="_blank">hasFocus</a>  and <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/css-binding.html" target="_blank">css bindings</a> in <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">KnockoutJS</a> to simplify binding and the need to keep state and track events to manage focus and
  blur and styling of input elements.&nbsp; This was good, but I have found that it can be improved further.&nbsp; In thinking about how to approach serializing my ViewModel graph in order to send information back to the server after users have interacted
  with the controls to which it is bound, I happened upon something that should have been obvious if I’d have thought it through, but escaped me earlier and that I have found to be useful and elegant now that I have encountered it.</p>

<h2>Serialization for server interaction and challenges</h2>
<p>KnockoutJS provides a simple and useful method for serializing ViewModel objects to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a> in <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/json-data.html" target="_blank">the toJSON() method</a>.&nbsp;
  It makes it easy to serialize ViewModel instances by calling ko.toJS, which recurses over what is passed to it and follows all the references and evaluating the observables to generate a plain JavaScript object with primitive properties (at least at
  the leaf nodes of the object tree), and then converting this to JSON.&nbsp; This is slick and convenient and works as advertised, but there are some gotchas.&nbsp; When calling ko.toJSON(), I was getting properties included in the resulting JSON I didn’t
  want included.&nbsp; Among these were Knockout computed properties and some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reference" target="_blank">circular references</a>.&nbsp; The circular references caused toJSON to fail.&nbsp; It gave nice and
  helpful error messages logged to the console that helped identify that circular references are not supported, but left me thinking about how to address this.&nbsp; Also, I was having exactly the same problem <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11673229/how-can-i-use-ko-tojs-method-without-computed-properties-in-knockout-mapping"
  target="_blank">stated simply and succinctly here</a> – I didn’t want to send the values of computed properties back to my server.&nbsp; The accepted answer given for the question by <a href="http://www.knockmeout.net/" target="_blank">Ryan Niemeyer</a>  contained a suggestion for using sub-observables.&nbsp; These are properties of observables.&nbsp; As Ryan points out, in Javascript, everything is an object.&nbsp; This includes functions.&nbsp; Because functions are objects, they can have properties.&nbsp;
  Because observables are functions, they are objects and therefore can have properties.&nbsp; Essentially, an observable is a function on which you can define properties.&nbsp; These “sub-observables” are not serialized by toJSON.&nbsp; They also read
  nicer when you want to have a property tracking whether a property is being edited, as in <a href="http://developeronfire.com/blog/combining-the-hasfocus-and-css-bindings-in-knockoutjs-rocks" target="_blank">my other post</a>.&nbsp; With this trick,
  I get two benefits: the property for defining whether the title is being edited is not serialized to JSON, and instead of having two properties related only by name, I now have a property with sub-properties.</p>
<p>Instead of:</p><pre>function ViewModel(durationSeconds) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var self = this;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.title = ko.observable('');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.editingTitle = ko.observable(false);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.headline = ko.observable('');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.editingHeadline = ko.observable(false);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
}</pre>
<p>I arrived at:</p><pre>function ViewModel(durationSeconds) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var self = this;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.title = ko.observable('');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.title.editing = ko.observable(false);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.headline = ko.observable('');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.headline.editing = ko.observable(false);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
}</pre>
<p>Binding is still straightforward:</p><pre>&lt;input type="text" id="title" data-bind="value:title, css: {editing: title.editing}, hasfocus:title.editing, event: { 'keyup': $root.textboxKeyup }"&gt;</pre>
<p>The “Live Example 2” on <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/extenders.html" target="_blank">the knockoutjs.com documentation page for extenders</a> demonstrates an extender for adding sub-observables for validation.&nbsp; It’s a brilliant idea
  further showing the utility of this trick.&nbsp; It also appears <a href="https://github.com/Knockout-Contrib/Knockout-Validation">there is a plugin</a> for including this functionality seamlessly.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Speaking of extenders, the code above can be improved further still.&nbsp; By using an extender to create the editing property on extended observables, it’s not necessary to explicitly add another property (thought it is necessary to explicitly add the
  extender).&nbsp; Thus, with the same binding, the earlier cited ViewModel can be simplified further as:</p><pre>function ViewModel(durationSeconds) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var self = this;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.title = ko.observable('').extend(trackEditing: false);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.headline = ko.observable('').extend(trackEditing: false);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
}</pre>
<p>The extender that enables this is the following code:</p><pre>ko.extenders.trackEditing = function(target, startValue) {<br><br>    target.editing = ko.observable(startValue || false);<br>    return target;<br>}</pre>
<p>With this small extender and the use of sub-observables, my ViewModel is now a lot easier to read.</p>
