<p>I was <a href="http://www.mylifeforthecode.com/episode-8-the-developer-on-fire-with-dave-rael/" target="_blank">recently interviewed for the My Life for the Code</a> podcast with Shawn Rakowski.&nbsp; It was an excellent experience.&nbsp; Shawn is an exceptional host and I really like <a href="http://www.mylifeforthecode.com/" target="_blank">his podcast and blog</a>.&nbsp; He’s a guy working hard in Minnesota to be a fired up developer and an awesome family man.</p> <p><a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/2eace893fbf0_E9EF/MyLifeForTheCode_1.jpg"><img title="MyLifeForTheCode" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="MyLifeForTheCode" src="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/2eace893fbf0_E9EF/MyLifeForTheCode_thumb_1.jpg" width="174" height="174"></a></p> <p>This is a chance for you to learn more about me and hear some of what makes me tick.</p> <p>The format of his show is similar to <a href="http://developeronfire.com/" target="_blank">mine</a> in the that the idea is to get software professionals to tell stories about the things that have shaped who they are and their experiences with delivering.&nbsp; It was an honor and a privilege to be featured as one of his guests.&nbsp; As you can probably tell, I like stories and I like hearing about what has driven the careers of developers who can be held out as good examples.&nbsp; I think Shawn is doing a great thing by sharing these stories.</p> <p>Please go and listen to my story.&nbsp; There are some valuable things to learn there and it’s just fun.&nbsp; It’s good to be able to dig into motivations and history.&nbsp; While you are there, please subscribe to his podcast to keep the stories and inspiration coming.</p> <p>Thanks, Shawn, for giving me this chance to to share and to be featured.</p> <p>Shawn will also be a guest on <a href="http://developeronfire.com/" target="_blank">Developer on Fire</a> – so keep an eye on <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/developeronfire" target="_blank">the feed</a> for that.</p>
