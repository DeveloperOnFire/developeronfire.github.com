<p>I am extremely fond of <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure offering</a>.&nbsp; I am hosting my current project, my blog sites (including this blog), and several test sites and projects in Azure
  and I have been really impressed with it.&nbsp; For my project, I am using an <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/websites/" target="_blank">Azure website</a> for my user interface, an <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/"
  target="_blank">Azure virtual machine</a> for my background processing, <a title="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-queues/" href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-queues/">Azure Storage Queues</a>  (as a transport for <a href="http://particular.net/nservicebus" target="_blank">NServiceBus</a>), <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs/">Blob Storage</a>, and <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/">Azure SQL databases</a>.&nbsp;
  There was a learning curve for dealing with Azure Storage Queues and their limitations and learning how they are different from MSMQ.&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Message_Queuing">Azure</a> SQL has some differences and limitations
  that need to be considered in comparison to managing your own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server">SQL Server</a>.&nbsp; Azure websites need some care and thought to get them to perform properly and I’ve found that the startup
  on the first request to a site that hasn’t been getting use and without a live and running IIS worker process takes a long time, though <a href="http://richardjgreen.net/windows-azure-web-sites-always-on/">there is a built-in feature in Azure that keeps the site running</a>.&nbsp;
  Other than these and some other growing pains, I have found the experience in working with Azure to be extremely pleasing.</p>

<p>I have used <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon AWS</a> for hosting applications before and I find their offering to be exceptional and excellent as well.&nbsp; I thought I would wind up hosting my current project there, but with Microsoft giving
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/">BizSpark program</a> participants $150/month in Azure credits, it seemed I needed to at least consider using Azure.&nbsp; I have also used <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> for some
  test sites and projects and I like it as well, primarily for pricing, as well as performance.&nbsp; It’s a good choice for projects that don’t benefit from using Windows Servers.&nbsp; Choosing to use NServiceBus means I am choosing to use .NET.&nbsp;
  This doesn’t have to mean using Windows, but it’s a shorter path to just go with Windows than dealing with the limitations of Mono.&nbsp; Also, I like Linux, but I’m more familiar and comfortable with Windows and it’s an easier maintenance story for
  me.&nbsp; In addition, <a href="http://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/windows-azure-transport">NServiceBus has support for using either Azure Storage Queues or Azure Service Bus as transports</a>.&nbsp; This seemed more appealing than needing to manage
  and/or implement my own transport in AWS or forgo NServiceBus and implement prevention of data loss, durable messaging, and workflow in some other way.&nbsp; It turned out that using Azure was a good choice for reasons beyond just the cost benefit from
  BizSpark.</p>
<h2>Azure Websites – Just plain easy</h2>
<p>The best thing about using Azure Websites is that you can easily create a site and deploy to it directly from Visual Studio via downloading a publishing profile from the Azure portal, or even better: <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-publish-source-control/"
  target="_blank">hook it to your source control for continuous deployment</a>.&nbsp; That continuous deployment is this easy and doesn’t require tons of scripting and infrastructure setup is a HUGE win.&nbsp; I am in love with Azure Websites for this
  alone.&nbsp; It’s really exciting that this works as well as it does and is as easy to set up as this.&nbsp; Beyond setup and deployment, using a website means there’s no need to worry about setting up and configuring the IIS webserver, creating sites
  and applications, patching the operating system or IIS, or any of that stuff.&nbsp; It’s also easy to configure the site to auto-scale with lots of options for types and numbers of machines and when to add and remove capacity.&nbsp; There is also a
  glut of images useful for creating sites using well-known web applications and frameworks, like WordPress, Drupal, Orachard CMS, and many other usual suspects.&nbsp; Using custom domains and SSL certificates is easy as well.&nbsp; In addition, for test
  sites and playing around or something where marketing/branding is not important, you can just use a subdomain under azurewebsites.net and away you go with a website available on the public internet.</p>
<h2>Virtual Machines – Flexible infrastructure on demand</h2>

<p>Virtual machines are exactly what I expected them to be – machines you can use to do whatever you need to do.&nbsp; Configuring access to ports with IP filtering is easy in the Azure portal, which is expected.&nbsp; There are a few things that surprised
  me, though.&nbsp; The first is how easy it is to beef up a machine that is under-provisioned for the workflow for which it is being used.&nbsp; I have a machine running my background processing doing some moderately CPU and memory intensive processing
  in bursts.&nbsp; Transcoding and compressing audio and video is the primary offender here.&nbsp; When I determined my machine was underpowered, I thought I would wind up doing what I have done in the same situation before in AWS – create an image of
  the machine, wait for the image to complete, create a new instance using the new image, wait for the new machine to come online and become available, transfer execution and references to the new machine, and shut down the old.&nbsp; To my shock and
  elation, I went into the Azure portal and just changed the pricing tier of the machine and saved the change.&nbsp; I was warned that the machine would have to restart.&nbsp; It did, without my having to do anything further.&nbsp; It came back up with
  more memory and 2 cores instead of one and handled my workload much better.&nbsp; This could not have been any easier and I was very impressed with what the Azure offering provided.&nbsp; Also wonderful (and at first shocking), you are not limited to
  Windows with Azure Virtual Machines.&nbsp; This is an exciting development from the new Microsoft that is very much the opposite of the old Evil Empire.&nbsp; This is not your daddy’s Redmond dynasty.</p>
<h2>SQL Azure – Limitations dying every day</h2>
<p>When I first started using SQL Azure, I found that the database engine itself was adequate for my needs and I was happy with being able to remotely access and administer my databases via Management Studio on my machine, but I was a little dismayed at
  some of the limitations of the capabilities of what I could do in the Management Studio client.&nbsp; It turns out that SQL Azure is not a full implementation of SQL Server hosted in Azure as I expected, but a different database engine that implements
  most of the protocol defined by SQL Server.&nbsp; This has meant that there are things I have done with SQL Server that I just can’t do with SQL Azure.&nbsp; First, a limitation that remains to this day is that I can’t use a using statement to select
  the database for which I am issuing statements.&nbsp; As a productivity junkie obsessed with keyboard use, this presented a problem.&nbsp; In addition, I also noticed early on that in a query Window in Management Studio, that after executing a query
  against a database, I could not switch to another database.&nbsp; This meant that the Ctrl-U combination for selecting a database from the dropdown in Management Studio works, but not as ideally as I would hope.&nbsp; It also meant that a mistaken execution
  against the Master database couldn’t be corrected without closing the query window and opening a new one.&nbsp; This was not disastrous, but frustrating.</p>
<p>It has been beautiful and exciting working with Azure, especially SQL Azure over the last few months and seeing it mature.&nbsp; Query Windows can now be switched to other databases on an Azure SQL Server instance with Ctrl+U without having to move to
  a new window.&nbsp; I have even seen it autocomplete the database selection dropdown after keying the first few characters of a database name (though I can’t make it do this consistently and haven’t figured out what magical conditions make it happen).&nbsp;
  The short version of what I am saying is that Microsoft is dedicated to make Azure better, and under the direction of Scott Guthrie, it is getting better every day and is a joy to use.</p>
