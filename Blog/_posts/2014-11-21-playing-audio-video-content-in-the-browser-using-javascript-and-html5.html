<p>Playing media on your website is no longer something that is just nice – it’s something you need to do.&nbsp; Consumers of content are accustomed to seeing fancy graphics and audio and video content as well.&nbsp; HTML5 makes it easy to put a media player
  onto your site with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio" target="_blank">&lt;audio&gt;</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video" target="_blank">&lt;video&gt;</a> tags.</p>

<p>The JavaScript API for dealing with these elements is pretty uniform, too, so you can deal with them in a similar way.&nbsp; For instance, if you have a use case where you want to play media on a page and the media may be either audio or video, it’s straightforward
  to use a variable to control a player of either type.&nbsp; This could be a result of allowing users to select something they’d like to play, perhaps based upon a list of available media from a database or something like that.&nbsp; In <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/raelyard/6wy0gzz3/1/"
  target="_blank">this fiddle</a>, I am demonstrating selection of different types of media using a dropdown list and playing them in a media player, selected based on the type of media.&nbsp; The parts that are interesting are the selection of which
  media player element to use and the controlling of the media player via a uniform API regardless of the one selected.&nbsp; I can acquire a reference to a media player element with something like one of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>var mediaPlayer = document.getElementsByTagName(‘audio’)[0];
    <br>var mediaPlayer = document.getElementsByTagName(‘video’)[0];</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a reference to a media player, it is straightforward to play and pause the media via javascript:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>mediaPlayer.play();
    <br>mediaPlayer.pause();</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or even a function to toggle between playing and pausing regardless of the current state:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>function togglePlayPause(mediaPlayer) {
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; mediaPlayer.paused ? mediaplayer.play() : mediaPlayer.pause();
    <br>}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A summary in the HTML5 specifications of the common functions and attributes available to media elements can be found <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-element" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is convenient that much customization can be done of the player, whether audio or video, via attributes on the media player element.&nbsp; The controls attribute gives the creator of the content control over whether the consumer of the content sees
  the built-in controls of the browser for being able to play/pause/seek/etc the media or whether the media are controlled entirely via JavaScript.&nbsp; The autoplay attribute controls whether the medium selected begins playing immediately or whether
  an explicit start is needed.&nbsp; There are many other attributes for controlling looping, buffering, and other aspects of playing media.&nbsp; The properties and events of the objects are also rich in what is exposed, such as duration, current time,
  and events for play, pause, completion, and download status.&nbsp; Playing media in the browser works very well and the cross-browser compatibility story is pretty good with modern, HTML5-enabled browsers.&nbsp; Google Chrome has some differences vs.
  others in how it handles streaming of media, and that will be addressed in another blog post.&nbsp; Put simply, &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; make it easy to play media in your pages the way you want to.</p>
