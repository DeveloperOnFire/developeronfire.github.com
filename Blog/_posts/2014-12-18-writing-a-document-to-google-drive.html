<p>The hardest part of dealing with the Google APIs is <a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/blog/authentication-via-oauth-to-communicate-with-google-apis" target="_blank">getting OAuth to work correctly</a> so that you can actually make the calls you intend to make.&nbsp; With that done, the rest is pretty straightforward.&nbsp; As a sample of something you might want to do, take writing a document to Google Drive.</p> <p><img style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Logo_of_Google_Drive.png"></p> <p>Creating a document is really just a POST request to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference/files/insert" target="_blank">Insert endpoint on the Files API</a>.&nbsp; This is really straightforward to do in C# with the Google.Apis.Drive.v2 Nuget package.&nbsp; First install the package:</p> <p>install-package Google.Apis.Drive.v2</p> <p>This package has a long list of dependencies and, therefore, this statement at the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio installs a large number of packages.</p> <p><br>&lt;packages&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;package id="Google.Apis" version="1.9.0" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;package id="Google.Apis.Auth" version="1.9.0" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;package id="Google.Apis.Core" version="1.9.0" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;package id="Google.Apis.Drive.v2" version="1.9.0.1540" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;package id="log4net" version="2.0.3" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;package id="Microsoft.Bcl" version="1.1.9" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;package id="Microsoft.Bcl.Async" version="1.0.168" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;package id="Microsoft.Bcl.Build" version="1.0.14" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;package id="Microsoft.Net.Http" version="2.2.22" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;package id="Newtonsoft.Json" version="6.0.4" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;package id="Zlib.Portable" version="1.10.0" targetFramework="net45" /&gt;<br>&lt;/packages&gt;</p> <p>With the Drive package installed we can now fill a stream with something to put into a text document and create a request to create a document.<br>var request = GetDriveService().Files.Insert(new File { Title = documentTitle }, stream, “text/plain”);</p> <p>where GetDriveService() is a function that will return an instance of DriveService from the Google.Apis.Drive.v2 package.</p> <p>Another line will submit the HTTP request to Google’s servers.<br>var response = await request.UploadAsync();</p> <p>(or you can use request.Upload() if you are scared of using <a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/blog/async-await-in-c-the-easy-way" target="_blank">async and await</a>)<br></p> <p>So a quick way to create a text document in the root of your Drive is with this:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>public async Task CreateDocument(string documentName, string documentContent)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using (var stream = new MemoryStream(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(documentContent)))<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var request = GetDriveService().Files.Insert(new File { Title = documentName }, stream, "text/plain");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var uploadResult = await request.UploadAsync();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Console.WriteLine("Google Drive document created - bytes: {0}; status: {1}; exception: {2}", uploadResult.BytesSent, uploadResult.Status, uploadResult.Exception);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>}</p></blockquote> <p>It’s not much harder to create such a document in another folder in your drive if you know the Id of the folder in which you want to put it:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>public async Task CreateDocument(string containingFolderId, string documentName, string documentContent)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using (var stream = new MemoryStream(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(documentContent)))<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var request = GetDriveService().Files.Insert(new File { Title = documentName Parents = new[] { new ParentReference { Id = containingFolderId } } }, stream, "text/plain");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var uploadResult = await request.UploadAsync();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Console.WriteLine("Google Drive document created - bytes: {0}; status: {1}; exception: {2}", uploadResult.BytesSent, uploadResult.Status, uploadResult.Exception);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>}</p></blockquote> <p>It’s worth noting here that the Parents property for the File you are creating uses collection semantics (the type is IList&lt;ParentReference&gt; – I’ve use an array of ParentReference here, which implements IList&lt;ParentReference&gt;, as a quick way to satisfy this), meaning a document can be in more than one folder.&nbsp; This is something that can be useful and is used regularly when sharing documents with others, but not something I’ll explore further in this post.&nbsp; You can see, though, how easy it would be to add additional parent folder Ids to the array.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Queries</h2> <p>If you want to insert a document (or any time of file) into a directory without know the Id for that directory (perhaps you know only the name), you need to find the Id.&nbsp; The query API is your friend here.&nbsp; Executing a query against Drive is really just a GET request on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference/files/list" target="_blank">List endpoint of the Files API</a>.&nbsp; Keep in mind that a folder in Google Drive is just yet another type of file.&nbsp; Getting a reference, including the Id, to a folder, is really straightforward to do in C# with the Google.Apis.Drive.v2 Nuget package.&nbsp; We’ve already been through installation of the package, so with it installed, you can execute a query with:<br>var request = service.Files.List();</p> <p>The request has a property called Q that is the string representing your query.&nbsp; Specifying a query with the above reference to a request looks like:</p> <p>request.Q = query;</p> <p>where query is potentially a parameter to a method or some variable with a query for Google (more in a moment on how a query would look).&nbsp; We can then execute this query with:</p> <p>var files = await request.ExecuteAsync();<br>(or you can use request.Execute() if you are scared of using <a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/blog/async-await-in-c-the-easy-way" target="_blank">async and await</a>)</p> <p>The code I’m using in my applications to execute a query is this:</p> <blockquote> <p>public async Task&lt;File&gt; ExecuteGoogleDriveQueryScalar(string query)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var queryResults = (await ExecuteGoogleDriveQuery(query));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return queryResults.Length &gt; 0 ? queryResults[0] : null;<br>}</p> <p>public async Task&lt;File[]&gt; ExecuteGoogleDriveQuery(string query)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return await ExecuteGoogleDriveQuery(query, file =&gt; 0);<br>}</p> <p>public async Task&lt;File[]&gt; ExecuteGoogleDriveQuery&lt;TSortProperty&gt;(string query, Func&lt;File, TSortProperty&gt; orderByFunc, bool orderByDescending = false)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (orderByFunc == null)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; orderByFunc = file =&gt; default(TSortProperty);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var request = GetDriveService().Files.List();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; request.Q = query;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var sortFunction = new Func&lt;IList&lt;File&gt;, IOrderedEnumerable&lt;File&gt;&gt;(collection =&gt; orderByDescending ? collection.OrderByDescending(orderByFunc) : collection.OrderBy(orderByFunc));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var files = await request.ExecuteAsync();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return sortFunction(files.Items).ToArray();<br>}</p></blockquote> <p>A reference for what to put in the string for querying can be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/web/search-parameters" target="_blank">here</a>. I’ll leave you to explore the majority of it to your interest, but give an example, in the theme of this post and for utility in using a query to find a folder by name.&nbsp; Finding a folder by name could look something like this:</p> <p>string.Format(“mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder' and title='{0}'”, soughtfolderName);</p> <p>You might want to limit the scope of the search to folders that are children of a particular parent folder:</p> <p>string.Format(“mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder' and '{0}' in parents and title='{1}'”, parentFolderId, soughtfolderName);</p> <h2>Something Unexpected</h2> <p>You have just seen how to create a file in a folder and how to find a folder.&nbsp; With this combination, you can create a file in a folder using the name of the folder.&nbsp; This isn’t the end of the story, though.</p> <p>You can imagine my surprise, when I found that my code that was querying Drive for a subdirectory by name and using it is found and creating it otherwise and creating files inside these folders to find that I wasn’t seeing the new directories with new files.&nbsp; This was code that had been working and creating files in the expected subdirectories.&nbsp; In retrospect, it’s probably something I should have expected, but I was still caught by surprise.</p> <p>If you remove a file from a folder on Google Drive either via the API or the browser user interface (or via some other mechanism like an authorized application or the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive" target="_blank">Google Drive desktop client</a>), the file goes into the trash.&nbsp; To be more precise, the file is labeled as having been trashed.&nbsp; It does not appear in the user interface anymore and is out of sight and out of mind.&nbsp; It is still there, though, and still will be found by queries.&nbsp; My code was looking for a subdirectory inside a parent directory and was finding it even though it wasn’t really there (OK, that’s a lie – it was there, it was just there and trashed and from the perspective of the Drive user interface, it looked like it wasn’t there).&nbsp; There files I was inserting into this directory (and the directory itself that I thought I was creating) were not surfacing in the user interface.&nbsp; This is because I was inserting files into a trashed subdirectory.&nbsp; If you want you query&nbsp; exclude trashed files, you need to tell it that.&nbsp; That makes our query look like this:</p> <p>string.Format(“mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder' and '{0}' in parents and title='{1}' and trashed = false”, parentFolderId, soughtfolderName);</p> <p>With all of this in place, we now have the following code to enable the easy creation of a document:</p> <blockquote> <p>public async Task CreateDocumentInNamedFolder(string folderName, string documentName, string documentContent)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; await CreateDocument((await GetFolderByName(folderName)).Id, documentName, documentContent);<br>}</p> <p>public async Task&lt;File&gt; GetFolderByName(string folderName)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return await ExecuteGoogleDriveQueryScalar(string.Format("mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder' and title='{0}' and trashed = false", folderName));<br>}</p></blockquote>
