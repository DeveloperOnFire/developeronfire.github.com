<p>Tagging audio files with meta-information about the person(s) responsible for the creation of the audio content, the genre of said content, and other bits of data is useful for consumers of content.&nbsp; It embeds information into the audio files themselves to be used by software and users.&nbsp; End-user applications such as ITunes, Windows Media Player, and podcast players use this information to provide display of information for selection and during playback of media.&nbsp; Typically, a podcast player will gather more information from a feed and what is embedded in the file is of less importance, but it still matters, especially with embedding images.&nbsp; In addition, if someone has downloaded your media file directly and has just the file in isolation, <a href="http://id3.org/" target="_blank">ID3 tagging</a> reveals information about the source and the content in the likes of Windows Explorer, the OS X Spotlight Search and Finder, and media playing software.&nbsp; If you are producing audio content and want the consumers of your product/art/propaganda to have an optimal experience, you should be including ID3 tags in the media files.</p> <p><a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/Tagging-Audio-Files-with-TagLib_10F1B/Fotolia_75060046_Subscription_Monthly_M_2.jpg"><img title="Girl with headphones and computer listening to music" style="border-top: 0px;

Often, though, particularly with podcasting, the information going into the tags is needed elsewhere.&nbsp; For instance, it will probably show up in a blog post or on some other web-exposed property.&nbsp; Instead of keying and/or copying and pasting this information to multiple places, we can do better.</p> <p>Custom software that writes tags is a better answer.&nbsp; I am currently working on a product that automates the entire workflow for publishing media content, including podcasts.&nbsp; A part of this process involves writing ID3 tags to the resulting audio files and uploading them to podcast hosts.&nbsp; The tagging portion is very straightforward, because I’m using <a href="https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp/" target="_blank">TagLib# (or if you prefer taglib-sharp)</a> an open-source library with a straightforward API that makes reading and writing tags a snap from C#.</p> <p>There is nothing more required to write tags to a file than to install the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/taglib/" target="_blank">package from Nuget</a></p> <p>install-package taglib</p> <p>and to create a function such as the following:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>public byte[] ExecuteTagging(byte[] inputFile, string title, string artist, string album, string comment, uint year, string copyright, byte[] image)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var stream = new MemoryStream();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var writer = new BinaryWriter(stream);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; writer.Write(inputFile);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using (var audioFile = TagLib.File.Create(new SimpleFileAbstraction(stream)))<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audioFile.Tag.Title = title;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audioFile.Tag.Performers = new[] { artist };<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audioFile.Tag.Album = album;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audioFile.Tag.Comment = comment;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audioFile.Tag.Genres = new[] { "Podcast" };<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audioFile.Tag.Year = year;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audioFile.Tag.Copyright = copyright;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audioFile.Tag.Pictures = new[] { new Picture(image) };<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audioFile.Save();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stream.Position = 0;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using (var reader = new BinaryReader(stream))<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return reader.ReadBytes((int)stream.Length);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>}</p></blockquote> <p>That’s all there is to it.&nbsp; ID3 tags to your audio files straight from your software.&nbsp; This code takes an input audio file as a byte array and an image to embed as a byte array and input to include in the tags and returns a byte array with the content of the tagged file.&nbsp; It may require some customization to fit other needs, but this is what I am using for my automation.&nbsp; Happy coding!</p>
