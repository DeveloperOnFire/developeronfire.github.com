<p>Psychologist Barry Schwartz made an observation about having a large variety of choices – that it comes with a set of problems.&nbsp; He wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060005688/?tag=devonfir-20" target="_blank">a book about this</a> and gave <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice" target="_blank">a popular talk</a> where he shared his thoughts.&nbsp; It was Dr. Schwartz who coined the term the “Paradox of Choice.”&nbsp; The assertion is that having a huge number of options is ultimately detrimental to our happiness.</p> <p><a href="http://raelyard.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/Caught-in-a-Local-Maximum_DDCB/ParadoxChoice_2.jpg"><img title="ParadoxChoice" style="border-left-width: 0px;

The interview is not yet published, but I’ll update this when it is.</p> <p><strong>Update: </strong>The <a href="http://developeronfire.com/Podcast/Episodes/cory-house-out-of-his-shell" target="_blank">interview with Cory</a> is available.</p> <p>I disagree with much of how Dr. Schwartz characterized the nature of the proliferation of choice and that the problems associated with it as an indictment on freedom itself.&nbsp; I think freedom means something very different from what he thinks it means.</p> <p><a href="http://raelyard.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/Caught-in-a-Local-Maximum_DDCB/InigoMontoya_2.jpg"><img title="InigoMontoya" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px;

It’s about a lack of coercion.&nbsp; It is violated by users of force, manipulation, deceit, and theft.&nbsp; It does not refer at all to how many choices are available, especially in the realm of products you can use.&nbsp; Choices here are provided by producers, not by liberty.&nbsp; A deficiency in liberty can mean a deficiency in producers which can mean an artificial limitation in choices.&nbsp; It’s not irrational to think that liberty and a proliferation of choice often correlate – in fact, it is the case.&nbsp; It’s a confusion of cause and effect, though, to say that freedom is maximized by maximizing choice.</p> <p>In software, licensing freedom can be used to refer to the rights of creators of software and the rights of users of software when they choose to use a particular piece of software.&nbsp; I look at the question of software licensing like this: </p> <ul> <li>If you create software, you should be able to choose if, how, under what terms/conditions, and at what price you share the resulting product and/or the source code.  <li>Using software is a choice and you should be able to make the choice to use any software you like, provided you adhere to the terms of use of such software.  <li>If you use software and/or its source code, you should adhere to the terms stipulated by the creator of the software, including payment of any price specified.&nbsp; If you don’t, you are committing theft.</li></ul> <p>The licensing of software and applying the term “free” to software is also often thought of in two ways: (going Latin): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre" target="_blank">Gratis versus libre</a>.&nbsp; This distinction is illustrated nicely in <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31717/what-do-the-phrases-free-speech-vs.-free-beer-really-mean/" target="_blank">the comparison of “free speech” to “free beer.”</a>&nbsp; This is important in open-source software because there are varying degrees and types of license and sharing of source code and pricing models to consider.</p> <p>This also has nothing to do with how many choices are available.</p> <p>Despite a strange way of using the term “freedom”, the observation that there are problems inherent in a broad array of choice is insightful, profound, and useful.&nbsp; It’s not a question of freedom and hopefully we can consider that distraction resolved and move on to what is impactful in what Dr. Schwartz has to say.</p> <p>It’s a common occurrence on my podcast that guests express a desire for greater time to dig into the new technologies popping up all the time.&nbsp; They want more time to learn new tools and new ways of thinking about problems.&nbsp; They lament the limitation time places on our activities – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost" target="_blank">the concept of the opportunity cost</a> – that choosing any one thing in any one moment of time means choosing not to engage in a great many other things.</p> <p align="center"><a href="http://raelyard.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/Caught-in-a-Local-Maximum_DDCB/Simultaneous_2.jpg"><img title="Simultaneous" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Simultaneous" src="http://raelyard.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/Caught-in-a-Local-Maximum_DDCB/Simultaneous_thumb.jpg" width="640" height="480"></a></p> <p>This is the paradox of choice – opportunity cost.&nbsp; Every platform, stack, tool, and environment has a learning curve.&nbsp; Spending time with any one thing means time not spent with another.&nbsp; It’s probably not possible to become and expert in everything.</p> <p>The story could end here with a statement that Dr. Schwartz hasn’t given us anything new.&nbsp; We already know about the paradox of choice from economics.</p> <p>That would be a mistake, though.</p> <p>Opportunity cost is like a virus.&nbsp; It’s consequences reproduce and spiral out in ways that multiply it’s impact.&nbsp; This is the contribution of what Dr. Schwartz has given.&nbsp; </p> <p>It begins with the paralysis we often face when presented with a many choices.&nbsp; Because of opportunity cost – because knowing that if one makes a less-than-optimal choice in selecting among many appealing options that she/he will have missed out on something even better, we hesitate to make a decision at all.&nbsp; We stress over making the choice.&nbsp; With stress comes procrastination.&nbsp; With procrastination comes distraction.&nbsp; Having many choices has many costs beyond just the investment involved in getting familiar with any one choice.</p> <p>Beyond opportunity cost, there is also the phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyer%27s_remorse" target="_blank">buyer’s remorse</a>.&nbsp; It is human to second guess every decision.&nbsp; It is also human to let this second guessing cause worry and harm and make it difficult to fully commit to a choice.&nbsp; With many options available, this stress is enhanced with many of the same multipliers as in the case of worry over opportunity cost.</p> <p>Another factor in this drama is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue" target="_blank">decision fatigue</a>.&nbsp; The idea is that we have a limited capacity for making decisions each day and that with each choice with which we are faced, a tank of decision juice is depleted, little by little.&nbsp; It also asserts that as we make decisions throughout the day, our ability to make sound choices decreases with each exercise.&nbsp; Making decisions about which tools and technologies to use drains our energy and our ability to make other decisions.&nbsp; It’s yet another drain on a finite resource.</p> <p>This, though, is a decision that matters.&nbsp; There are many decisions that don’t matter in our lives that sap our ability to make good decisions.</p> <p>I dislike citing politicians as examples of behavior to emulate because they are almost always examples of reprehensible behavior (which is why I love so much that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJM-QzhB4pM" target="_blank">Palpatine is a politician</a>), but there’s a case I think is an exception: I’ve heard a story asserting that Barrack Obama has a closet full of identical suits (in searching for a resource for this story I Google Obama closet – don’t do that).&nbsp; I don’t know or care if this is really true and the identity of the person is inconsequential.&nbsp; The point is the illustration of the power of processes to remove decisions from daily life and keep the tank of decision juice filled for those decisions that do matter.</p> <p>By having many suits that are all the same, the wearer of the suit does not have to spend any energy deciding which suit to wear – a decision that is completely unimportant.&nbsp; The clothing I have is not identical, but I always use the shirt closest to the opening of the closet for this reason.</p> <p>I don’t have an answer for the paradox of choice.&nbsp; I struggle with the icy grip of this powerful nemesis like anyone else.&nbsp; Minimizing trivial decisions is a move in the right direction, but it addresses only a small piece of a larger problem.</p> <p>The psychological toll of proliferation of choice is great and terrifying.&nbsp; This is why the paradox of choice presents such a problem.&nbsp; Still, it’s better than the opposite problem of having nothing good from which to choose, as Cory and I agreed on the podcast.</p> <p>Thank you to Cory House and to Barry Schwartz, for pointing out the insidious problems inherent in our lives due to abundant choice.&nbsp; This is true in many parts of our lives, certainly in how we create software.</p>
