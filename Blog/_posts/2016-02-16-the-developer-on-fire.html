<p>I called my podcast “Developer On Fire” for a few reasons.&nbsp; The most obvious is that it’s patterned after <a href="http://www.eofire.com/" target="_blank">Entrepreneur on Fire</a> – the show that was the reason Developer On Fire came about in the
  first place.&nbsp; I wrote a bit about the genesis of the idea in <a href="http://http://developeronfire.com/blog/my-podcast-is-live" target="_blank">my initial blog post sharing that I had started podcasting</a>.&nbsp; Additionally, the theme of the
  show is the stories of developers who have accomplished something or are inspired to accomplish something.&nbsp; The idea of being a “developer on fire” is something of great significance to me.&nbsp; I’m not always on fire, myself, but I want to be.&nbsp;
  I love sharing the stories of software people who have tapped into something in the universe that makes what they do fulfilling.&nbsp; I doubt anyone feels that all the time.&nbsp; Perhaps the show is missing something – maybe some piece on a lack of
  being lit up. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.tripplanier.com/about/" target="_blank">Tripp Lanier</a> is an admirable character.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.thenewmanpodcast.com/" target="_blank">His podcast</a> is one I recommend frequently.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he is focused
  on other things and doesn’t put out new episodes very often anymore.&nbsp; He calls himself a “men’s coach,” but I don’t think what he has to offer is specific to a single gender.&nbsp; In the materials in and around the podcast, he emphasizes being
  “lit up.”&nbsp; It’s a term that resonates to my core.&nbsp; I wrote a <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2015/09/30/you-dont-have-to-do-what-you-are-good-at/" target="_blank">post on the Simple Programmer site</a> about emphasizing your strengths
  in your life.&nbsp; Patterned after the teachings of Tripp, the idea is that you are best off doing those things that fill your tank, that make you whole, that bring you joy.&nbsp; The idea is that activities done from obligation sap your life-force,
  drain your energy, and make you less alive.</p>

<p>Life is short.&nbsp; <a href="https://sivers.org/" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> did the world the great favor of sharing the awsome formulation “<a href="https://sivers.org/hellyeah" target="_blank">No more yes. It's either HELL YEAH! or no.</a>”&nbsp;
  I’ve mentioned his blog post <a href="http://developeronfire.com/episode-077-daniel-marbach-geeking-out" target="_blank">a</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://developeronfire.com/episode-050-cory-house-out-of-his-shell" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="http://developeronfire.com/episode-034-michael-crump-family-first-with-passion-for-tech"
  target="_blank">times</a> on the podcast and completely misidentified him.&nbsp; I didn’t know who he was and called him “some kind of internet marketer or something,” when in fact he’s a person with many interests and skills (among them programming).&nbsp;
  His <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/12/14/derek-sivers-on-developing-confidence-finding-happiness-and-saying-no-to-millions/" target="_blank">conversation with Tim Ferriss</a> was wonderful and he is, in fact, a developer on fire.</p>
<h2>What are the pieces that make for a lit up developer on fire</h2>
<p>Several potential guests with whom I have spoken have expressed not feeling they were of the quality of some of my other guests.&nbsp; It’s natural to feel that way.&nbsp; Seeing a list including some of the biggest names in software is intimidating.&nbsp;
  It’s funny that I’ve done these interviews one-by-one and with close to 100 released (and over 100 recorded), it no longer seems weird that I’ve talked to <a href="http://developeronfire.com/episode-057-ward-cunningham-exceeding-expectations-with-joy-curiosity-and-discovery"
  target="_blank">Ward Cunningham</a> and <a href="http://developeronfire.com/episode-032-ted-neward-presence-and-values" target="_blank">Ted Neward</a>.&nbsp; It amazes me that <a href="http://developeronfire.com/episode-024-mark-seemann-abstract-value"
  target="_blank">Mark Seemann</a> is listening to the show and giving feedback and cares about the content and <a href="http://developeronfire.com/developer-on-fire-096-chad-fowler-being-deliberate" target="_blank">Chad Fowler</a> and <a href="http://developeronfire.com/developer-on-fire-097-bryan-hunter-reducing-fear"
  target="_blank">Bryan Hunter</a> had great things to say about what I’m doing.&nbsp; These are some of my programming heroes.&nbsp; Hearing those things is rewarding.&nbsp; That lights me up.</p>
<p>Like many Test-Driven Development adherents have said – feedback cycles are of utmost importance.&nbsp; Getting positive feedback on my work with the show is enormously rewarding, especially from people I view as having a direct pipeline to a higher form
  of insight.</p>
<p>Feedback doesn’t need to come in the form of positive words from living software legends.&nbsp; In fact, the best place from which it can come is users.&nbsp; Please, communicate with the users of the things you make and find out how they are benefitting
  from your efforts.&nbsp; This is, in my estimation, the shortest path to being a developer on fire.</p>
<p>Seek feedback, also, from people even more important than your users.&nbsp; If you have a family, understand how your efforts benefit them.&nbsp; But do not let your work get in the way of your family.&nbsp; If you know your priorities and you receive
  the joy of close relationships, you are certain to achieve rewards not possible from mere accomplishment.&nbsp; The best way to receive joy in relationships is to give.&nbsp; The best way to give in relationships is to receive.</p>
<h2>On Passion</h2>
<p>Having had <a href="http://developeronfire.com/developer-on-fire-096-chad-fowler-being-deliberate" target="_blank">Chad Fowler on the show</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1934356344/?tag=devonfir-20" target="_blank"><em>The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development</em></a><em>, </em>and
  with an emphasis on lighting a fire under software professionals, you’d think the next word out of my mouth (errr, keyboard) would be “passion.”&nbsp; I hesitate to use that term, though.&nbsp; <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/about/" target="_blank">Avdi Grimm</a>  addressed the subject of passion in <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2014/02/10/the-passion-gospel/" target="_blank">his post: The Passion Gospel</a>.&nbsp; (I’m not completely sure whether to call it a long blog post or a short book, though – it takes
  some commitment to get through it.)&nbsp; His distaste for the overuse of the term and giving some perspective to the things that really matter is right on the mark.&nbsp; His point regarding passionate behavior equating to emotional outbursts and a
  source of regrettable experiences is insightful and reflects my reality as well.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since writing this, I have <a href="http://developeronfire.com/episode-108-avdi-grimm-your-passion-is-yours-and-yours-alone" target="_blank">spoken with Avdi on the podcast</a>.</p>

  <a href="http://raelyard.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/The-Developer-On-Fire_D68A/passionfruit_2.jpg"><img title="passionfruit" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto"

</p>
<p>Thank you Avdi, for a great post (or should I say book?).&nbsp; It is thought-provoking and pushes back on an unhealthy spiritual obsession.&nbsp; That my podcast idea originated with listening to an entrepreneur podcast makes me conscious of the rabid
  overuse of the word “passion” among business owners.&nbsp; So much of the type of rhetoric heard form communities of founders really reflects this dogma.&nbsp; The emphasis on “following your passion” I’ve heard from some podcasts and other sources
  had been starting to feel a little tired and misguided.&nbsp; Avdi articulated well much of my sentiment there – things I was feeling but couldn’t fully state.</p>
<h2>A Positive Direction</h2>
<p>I still want to be a developer on fire.&nbsp; I want to be lit up on life and solving problems with software.&nbsp; I want to make life better for someone somewhere.&nbsp; Software isn’t the only way to do that, though.&nbsp; Avdi has helped to program
  my <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Navigation_computer" target="_blank">navi-computer</a> with some more useful input.&nbsp; I love this part:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can still be enthusiastic and conscientious about your work. You can still love what you do, and care deeply about your team and about creating something of high quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there it is.&nbsp; A developer on fire is not necessarily a passionate programmer.&nbsp; A developer on fire is perhaps not possibly a passionate programmer (as Avdi also says in the <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2014/01/31/the-moderately-enthusiastic-programmer/"
  target="_blank">post that preceeded</a> The Passion Gospel (which must be read for context, adding to the overall length of the thesis), this is not meant to denigrate Chad Fowler nor his work – in fact it is very much in line with his thinking).&nbsp;
  <a href="http://developeronfire.com/developer-on-fire-096-chad-fowler-being-deliberate" target="_blank">Please listen to Chad Fowler on Developer On Fire</a>.&nbsp; He paints a picture of someone excited about his work, but even more excited about his
  human experience.&nbsp; I love the way he emphasized mindfulness.&nbsp; I like to focus on presence in my life.&nbsp; Though I fail frequently, my ideal to which I strive is that when my declared purpose is a software or technical challenge, that I
  am fully engaged in that exercise with all my mind, that when I am with my family, my whole consciousness is dedicated, that when I am speaking with a podcast guest, there is no distraction and what they have to say occupies my being.</p>
<p>A developer on fire is a person first and programmer nth.&nbsp; There are more important things in life.&nbsp; But that person is lit up and one of the sources of ignition is using software to solve problems.&nbsp; It’s not code for the sake of code,
  but a focus on the problem domain and the humanity of the user of technology to try to make life better.&nbsp; Avdi’s point about the folly and delusions of grandeur common among founders and programmers is well-founded, but I’d still like to think
  I can and have and will make a positive impact on the quality of existence of at least myself and a few others, hopefully a lot of others.&nbsp; Sharing stories and conversations with awesome people is another part of that impact.&nbsp; Raising a competent,
  confident, conscientious, and self-sufficient family if an even bigger piece of that impact.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Be mindful of your priorities, young Padawan, and you may be a Developer On Fire yet.</p>
