<p>Since acquiring my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, I’ve been using <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/">Boot Camp</a> extensively to be able to run either OS X or Windows on hardware as my application and performance
  needs dictate.&nbsp; I also use Virtual Box to be able to run Windows from within OS X, but most of the time, if I am developing software, my life is better running my operating system on the real hardware.&nbsp; I have had my machine set up to boot
  by default to Windows, meaning if I wanted to boot into OS X, I needed to wait patiently following a my issuing of a reboot command from either Windows or OS X for the machine to shut down and then to start back up again and hold the Option (Alt) key
  down while the startup sequence starts to be presented with a user interface I can use to select the disk partition from which I want to boot.&nbsp; I was tired of doing this and decided there had to be a better way.&nbsp; There is and I have found
  it.</p>
<p>In Windows, if you install the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1720">Boot Camp drivers</a>, you have options for controlling how Boot Camp operates, including having access to a menu in the system tray with options for things like booting into
  OS X and a control panel for controller keyboard options and TrackPad operation.&nbsp; This is helpful for making the machine and the uncomfortable (in Windows) Macintosh keyboard operate in a way that is a little easier to use.&nbsp; The option to
  boot straight to OS X is what we were after and came here to find, so we could say we’re done.&nbsp; Good night.&nbsp; Thanks for coming.</p>

<p>No, we’re not done yet.&nbsp; Yes, this is an improvement over simply rebooting and having to interrupt the default boot, but we can still do a lot better.</p>
<p>The Boot Camp drivers also include command line support.&nbsp; The software installation puts an executable file on the Windows disk partition that can be used to control operation of Boot Camp from the command line.&nbsp; For a keyboard zealot like myself,
  this is the magical music I was seeking.&nbsp; It exists in</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>C:\Program Files\Boot Camp\Bootcamp.exe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using this executable, I was able to create a PowerShell function that will set the default boot option to my OS X partition and reboot my machine.&nbsp; Magically, the machine comes up in the Apple Operating system (and the stands with the silver chrome
  sweaters stand and cheer).&nbsp; I added a BootCamp.ps1 script to the functions directory of my PowerShell setup.&nbsp; My PowerShell profile automatically dot sources all the scripts in this directory so I can use them anywhere.&nbsp; I also added
  aliases for my function.</p>
<p>Functions\BootCamp.ps1:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>function script:bootToOsX
    <br>{
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; "C:\Program Files\Boot Camp\Bootcamp.exe" -StartupDisk "Macintosh HD"
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restart-computer -force
    <br>}
    <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aliases\BootCamp.aliasas</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"reboot-osx","bootToOsX","","None"
    <br>"restart-computer-osx","bootToOsX","","None"
    <br>"osx","bootToOsX","","None"</p>
  <p>"reboot-mac","bootToOsX","","None"
    <br>"restart-computer-mac","bootToOsX","","None"
    <br>"mac","bootToOsX","","None"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, from PowerShell, I can boot to OS X with a single command and I can do it with one of many aliases (in case I forget what I called it.&nbsp; Issuing osx or mac are the shortest and easiest to remember.&nbsp; My PowerShell profile and all my scripts
  are available for reference or use at via <a href="https://bitbucket.org/raelyard/setup" target="_blank">a Bitbucket Mercurial repository</a>.</p>
<p>This is great and all and enables an easy switch, but that’s not all I wanted to accomplish.&nbsp; It’s not enough to go from Windows to OS X.&nbsp; Additionally, this changes the default so that if I manually go back into Windows, subsequent reboots
  would land me back in OS X.&nbsp; It is not ideal for a software update to cause a reboot and for the machine to come back in a different operating system, no matter which is running.&nbsp; If I’m in OS X and an update causes a reboot, I want to boot
  back to OS X and I don’t want to have to do anything to make it happen.&nbsp; The benefit of this default switch is that now, if I’m in OS X and reboot for whatever reason (which should be done with a&nbsp; sudo reboot rather than clicking a button),
  I want to come back to OS X.&nbsp; Now I have that.&nbsp; For this to be a complete success, though, I need to be able to use the command line from OS X and make the same thing happen – set Windows as the default boot partition and reboot the machine.&nbsp;
  I have accomplished that, <a href="http://superuser.com/a/167577/301156">thanks to this answer</a>, by using bless for setting startup disk options with this script:</p>
<p>reboot-windows.sh</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>bless -mount "/Volumes/BOOTCAMP" -legacy -setBoot
    <p>reboot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The superuser.com answer use the option –nextonly to have this change to the boot disk apply only to the next boot and leave the OS X volume as the default boot disk.&nbsp; This is not what I wanted, as stated earlier, so I omitted that.&nbsp; With this
  script in place, I can easily reboot to Windows from the command line and I’m able to go “There and Back Again.”&nbsp; When in one operating system, simple reboot commands bring me back to the same operating system and I can easily issue a command to
  switch which operating system that is, exactly as I wanted.</p>
