<p>I despise the way the term “respect” is frequently used.&nbsp; When expectations are set for the interactions of a team or organization or classroom, “showing respect” is frequently cited as a prerequisite for civility.&nbsp; This is an abuse of language
  and, more importantly, an abuse of the concept.&nbsp; Saying that respect is an expectation is unreasonable, silly, and wrong.&nbsp; It may be that this is just a question of semantics and folks are using the wrong word to mean the right thing, but
  if that’s the case, it’s time to clarify.&nbsp; I recently heard the incomparable <a href="http://thepaulrayner.com/" target="_blank">Paul Rayner</a> give a presentation regarding <a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/" target="_blank">Behavior Driven Development</a>  (though as an Aussie, he’d call it Behaviour Driven Development and we can forgive him for that).&nbsp; He said a lot of things of value in the presentation, but one of the simpler things resonated with me the most.&nbsp; He stated simply and effectively
  and efficiently regarding communication of the domain language that “language matters.”</p>

<p>The word “respect” is overused.&nbsp; I don’t want to say anything hyperbolic like “it’s the most overused term in the English language” because I haven’t given the matter enough thought to make such an absolute and grandiose statement.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
  it’s an overused term and I don’t like the way it is use in a majority of cases.&nbsp; What is respect?&nbsp; The source used by Google to return definitions yields:</p>

        <p>We can disregard noun definition 2 as it is something not relative to the way in which respect is used to which I object.&nbsp; Noun definition 1 and verb definition 1 are essentially the same thing – the noun is the state of having reverence
          for someone or something and the verb is the act of having reverence for someone or something.&nbsp; The key here is that it is the reverence is for the “abilities, qualities, or achievements” of the object of the respect.&nbsp; This means that
          respect is a reaction to something virtuous in another.&nbsp; Recognition of virtue is not something that should be given by default.&nbsp; I will only say that I respect a person when they have demonstrated virtue.&nbsp; Respect is not given
          by default – it is earned.&nbsp; Thus, I will not give you my respect until you have demonstrated that you are worthy of it.&nbsp; The virtue of a person like <a href="http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/" target="_blank">Rob Eisenberg</a>          is an example of being worthy of respect.&nbsp; Rob is an amazing developer and an amazing person.&nbsp; His contributions to the software community and to the world are remarkable.&nbsp; <a href="http://developeronfire.com/Podcast/Episodes/rob-eisenberg-social-rewards-and-doing-your-best"
          target="_blank">I interviewed him for my podcast</a> and it was remarkably clear in that conversation that he was present and giving his best to the task at hand.&nbsp; I think that’s why things like <a href="https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro"
          target="_blank">Caliburn Micro</a>, <a href="http://durandaljs.com/" target="_blank">Durandal</a>, and <a href="http://aurelia.io/" target="_blank">Aurelia</a> are so amazing – he personifies presence and giving his essence to the task at hand
          – he has demonstrated on occasion after occasion that he is worthy of respect.&nbsp; Rob Eisenberg has my respect because he’s an outstanding software person and simply an exceptional person.&nbsp; His emphasis on family is further evidence
          of the type of person he is.&nbsp; I love my interview with him and think it’s the best of what <a href="http://developeronfire.com/" target="_blank">my podcast</a> has to offer (so far).
          <p>I have heard parents demand respect from their children.&nbsp; This is a heinous abuse of power.&nbsp; Respect cannot be demanded.&nbsp; It must be earned.&nbsp; If my children respect me (and I think they do), I will not accept that it is because
            I have imposed and demanded and forced respect out of them.&nbsp; If I have (and I haven’t), it is not respect.&nbsp; Fear and respect are very different things.&nbsp; I do not want fear from my children.&nbsp; I want their respect and my
            every action toward them (I hope) reflects that desire and that I want to prove worthy of that lofty goal.&nbsp; I have recently seen enormous behavior changes in my son.&nbsp; He has decided that he wants to be like dad in many ways.&nbsp;
            Nothing could thrill me more.&nbsp; It is also terrifying, because it is an enormous responsibility.&nbsp; Seeing the way my son emulates my behavior makes clear that I must be my best or I’m damning not only myself, but also those most precious
            to me to the consequences of less-than-optimal choices.&nbsp; It sounds a bit silly to quote comic books, but “with great power comes great responsibility.”&nbsp; I must be my best to make sure I am teaching by my example.&nbsp; This is, to
            me, the meaning of respect.&nbsp; It is my hope that my children (and others) will respect me not because of power I exert over them, but because of my worthiness.&nbsp; Demanding respect is unproductive, an exercise in futility, and a wasteful
            and immature action.&nbsp; You can do better.
            <p>I am not arguing for the Wild West of treating people in any way less than that prescribed by the Golden Rule.&nbsp; I’m not saying it’s not important to treat others well.&nbsp; I just think a different word is more appropriate for this and
              that it communicates better what we are after: courtesy.&nbsp; Courtesy refers to treating other civilly and in a manner one would like to receive in return.&nbsp; Returning to the Google definition provider well, courtesy is this:
              <p><i>noun</i>

                  <p>You get my courtesy by default.&nbsp; I will be courteous to you until you prove that you are unworthy of it.&nbsp; Even then there’s a degree of courtesy I will proffer to even the most unworthy.&nbsp; Courtesy refers to civil discourse.&nbsp;
                    Respect is a completely different matter.&nbsp; It is a measure of virtue, a measure of admiration, a feeling of reverence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying that you should be respectful to everyone cheapens and demeans what it means to truly respect
                    someone because they are truly admirable.
                    <p>In summary: courtesy should be given by default and restricted only on a black-list basis.&nbsp; Respect should be withheld by default and only granted on a white-list basis.
