<p>There is a common theme among motivational and inspirational media encouraging “<a href="http://www.inc.com/leigh-buchanan/big-ideas/jim-collins-big-hairy-audacious-goals.html" target="_blank">Big Hairy Audacious Goals</a>.”&nbsp; It is not my intent to argue that this is bad – in fact, it’s great.&nbsp; I think most of us, myself included, suffer from thinking too small.&nbsp; Big goals are your friend in determining the direction of your life.&nbsp; You may feel misled, at this point, by my title.&nbsp; I’m not arguing at all that you should not pursue great and awesome things.&nbsp; I intend to present how I think you should approach those things.</p> <p><a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/Media/OptimizedProgrammer/Windows-Live-Writer/Your-Goals-are-Too-Big_535E/Fugel_David_gegen_Goliath_2.jpg"><img title="TofG 191" style="border-top: 0px;

When Bill Gates and Paul Allen, in the 1980s decided they had a goal of creating the software that enabled getting a personal computer in every home, they were dealing in the realm of what could not be viewed as anything other than impossible.&nbsp; It is only slightly exaggerating to say that what they were able to accomplish was miraculous.&nbsp; It is one of the great achievements of human history.&nbsp; It could be argued that it was inevitable and would have happened without Microsoft.&nbsp; It has been argued that the world would have been better off without “the Evil Empire.”&nbsp; Despite these potential objections, the fact remains that a ludicrous goal was attained and we should all marvel.&nbsp; Again – giant goals are great.&nbsp; I don’t think, though, that they just started from that vision and measured their progress against that each day and said “Yep, we’re 0.00000000000001% of the way there.”&nbsp; That is a demoralizing approach.&nbsp; That is the path to unfinished projects (and the Dark Side).&nbsp; In order to make progress against large goals, there need to be milestones along the way.&nbsp; We need smaller goals that support the larger goals.&nbsp; This is the point – giant goals are great for direction and identifying the right small goals – microgoals are THE way forward for daily progress and effort and sanity.</p> <p>An example I have heard to illustrate the value of microgoals is that of writing a book.&nbsp; Having a goal of “write today” or make progress on book” is lacking in meaning and it’s hard to say whether it was done or not.&nbsp; Something like “write 500 words” or “complete chapter 3” is a concrete and reachable goal and you know when you are done.&nbsp; Writing a book is too big a task to have meaningful progress in a day.&nbsp; It is no different with writing software.</p> <p>When implementing a large feature that takes many weeks to complete, imagine what your daily progress reports might reveal (if you are doing daily progress reports – if not, I suggest using something like <a href="https://idonethis.com" target="_blank">iDoneThis</a> or <a href="http://www.teamreporterapp.com/" target="_blank">Teamreporter</a> to track what you are accomplishing, ideally with your team, but individually works too).&nbsp; If you are working on the big feature and each day you have a progress report saying “Made progress on Big Feature,” your progress reports have limited value (perhaps no value).&nbsp; If instead, you have broken your large task down into smaller tasks, you can have a meaningful progress report showing items you have completed.&nbsp; It feels a lot better to have a list of things completed rather than a nebulous list of meaningless “progress.”&nbsp; I’m not saying progress is bad, just that it doesn’t communicate much.&nbsp; Feeling better might seem like a small thing, but the encouragement that comes from knocking things out rather than looking at the same task day after day has a significant impact to motivation and productivity.</p> <p>Think about this – it’s nothing new to say that you should not be working on code for a long time without committing to source control.&nbsp; <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Atwood</a> <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/check-in-early-check-in-often/" target="_blank">addressed the topic</a> in 2008, which was late to the party.&nbsp; If you are committing something to source control, you should be doing it every day.&nbsp; When something is ready to commit, you are making a statement that you have completed something and that it has been tested and implemented to your satisfaction in solving some piece of whatever it is you are trying to do.&nbsp; Source control systems (decent ones anyway) require a message with your commit.&nbsp; This is because you should be describing why you made changes every time you have completed changes.&nbsp; Right here you have a completed task.&nbsp; Every commit to source control is a cause for celebration – it is the completion of something you needed to do, a check in the proverbial box.&nbsp; In addition to being a great demarcation for what you have accomplished, commits to source control are awesome for tracking because they enable <a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/blog/self-tracking%E2%80%93motivations-goals-and-effort" target="_blank">effortless tracking</a> via <a href="http://optimizedprogrammer.com/blog/effortless-to-done-tracking" target="_blank">automation</a>.&nbsp; The ideal size for goals for a day is that you should be able to accomplish many of them in a day.&nbsp; I often have daily reports with IDoneThis showing 10-20 items (some personal in addition to technical and business activities).</p> <p>It is a worn cliché that the optimal approach to eating an elephant is to do so one bite at a time.&nbsp; There is a good reason for this – large goals are best approached by decomposition and attacking the component pieces one at a time.&nbsp; This is not any different for software than it is for the ingestion of large creatures.&nbsp; Small goals with frequent accomplishment (in support of larger goals) is the Optimized Programmer way of operating.&nbsp; Every completion of every small task is an achievement worthy of celebration.</p>
