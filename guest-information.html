<div>This will book a 1 hour time slot - I expect our interview to take 35-45 minutes, but like to allot an hour so we can chat a bit before and/or after.</div>
<div>Please also give me these things:</div>
<ul>
<li>Please send me a contact request on Skype - I am <strong>raelyard</strong> on Skype - or&nbsp;share your Skype id with me.</li>
<li>Also, Please send me a short bio that describes who you are and what you do and a photo (ideally a headshot) of yourself to include in my show notes (you can just give me a link to it and I'll download).</li>
<li>Also also, Please make sure you have headphones you can use for the call.  If you are using speakers, my sound will feed back into your microphone and impair the pristine recordings I have of both sides.</li>
<li>Also also also,&nbsp;I will want a local recording of your audio so I don't have to trust what I receive from Skype as your end of the conversation. &nbsp;There's a great product to facilitate this, so you don't need to install anything (unless you don't have a modern browser). &nbsp;You'll only need to visit a link in your browser (Chrome or Firebox, please) and authorize your browser to use your microphone. &nbsp;I'll give you the link when we record.</li>
</ul>
