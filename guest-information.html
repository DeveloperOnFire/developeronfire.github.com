<p>Below is some info about my format and my standard questions so you don't go in blind. &nbsp;Here is a link to schedule a time with me:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.meetme.so/DevOnFire">http://www.meetme.so/DevOnFire</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>This will book a 1 hour time slot - I expect our interview to take 40-50 minutes, but like to allot an hour so we can chat a bit before and/or after.</p>
<p>After you are scheduled on the calendar, the calendar entry will be updated to reflect a <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> meeting as the location with a link to join. Zoom requires a download and installation, but it's super small, super fast, and super easy.</p>
<p>Please also give me these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please send me a short bio that describes who you are and what you do and a photo (ideally a headshot) of yourself to include in my show notes (you can just give me a link to it and I'll download).</li>
<li>Also, Please make sure you have headphones you can use for the call.  If you are using speakers, my sound will feed back into your microphone and impair the pristine recordings I have of both sides.</li>
<li>Also also, I will want a local recording of your audio so I don't have to trust what I receive from Zoom as your end of the conversation. There's a great product I'm using to facilitate this, called <a href="">Zencastr</a>>, so you don't need to install anything (unless you don't have a modern browser). It doesn't support Safari or Edge or IE (at the time I wrote this), so you'll only need Chrome or Firebox. All you'll need to do is hit the link I give you when we meet and authorize your browser to use your microphone.</li>
</ul>

<p>Podcast information:</p>
<p>Developer On Fire with Dave Rael is an interview podcast with inspiring and successful software professionals telling personal stories about their experiences with delivering value. &nbsp;It is a chance for you to get to know your favorite geeks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The idea of the show is to get guests to tell stories about their experiences in their software development careers and to share the insight and wisdom acquired.  To this end, there is a set of standard questions.  Not every episode will feature all of the standard questions.  This is not a robotic effort to get throught the list.  They are intended to get stories.  If there are stories being expressed without the standard questions, questions may be skipped.  Generally, all episodes will include a book recomendation and finish with 3 tips.  The rest of the questions may or may not make it in.  This is, after all, a conversation and open to going in the direction that will best serve the listener.</p>
<p>Standard questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What lights you up about technology and what you are currently doing?</li>
<li>How did you get started writing software?</li>
<li>Please share a story about time you failed.</li>
<li>Please share the story of your greatest success. &nbsp;Make sure you share how this experience delivered value.</li>
<li>How do you stay current with what you need to know?</li>
<li>Book Recommendation</li>
<li>What has you the most excited about your current projects and future?</li>
<li><span><span>What are the greatest sources of pain in your life and work?</span></span></li>
<li>What do you geek out about other than software that really lights you up?</li>
<li><span><span>Can you make one prediction for the future of software?</span></span></li>
<li>3 tips for delivering more value - they don't have to be programming or software related, but should facilitate delivering.</li>
</ul>
