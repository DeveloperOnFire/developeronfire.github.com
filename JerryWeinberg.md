    bio: "Gerald M. Weinberg (Jerry) has always been interested in helping smart people be happy and productive. To that end, he has published books on human behavior, including Weinberg on Writing: The Fieldstone Method, The Psychology of Computer Programming, Perfect Software and Other Fallacies, and the 4-volume General Systems Series. He has also written several books on teamwork and leadership including Becoming a Technical Leader, Agile Impressions, Do You Want to Be a (better) Manager, The Secrets of Consulting, More Secrets of Consulting, and the multi-volume Quality Software series. He incorporates his knowledge of science, engineering, and human behavior into all of writing and consulting work (with writers, hi-tech researchers, and software engineers). He writes novels about such peopleâ€”all about how his brilliant protagonists produce quality work and learn to be happy."
